[135777: Enable WatchCacheInitializationPostStartHook by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/135777)

This PR enables the WatchCacheInitializationPostStartHook by default in the apiserver, improving the reliability of watch cache initialization during startup. By ensuring the watch cache is properly initialized before the apiserver becomes ready, this change strengthens startup guarantees and reduces subtle race conditions affecting watch behavior.
