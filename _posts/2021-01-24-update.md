## Developer News

Davanum Srinivas has proposed [removing golint verification](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98063) because of the amount of overhead for contributors & reviewers.

[kube-state-metrics project](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/) is looking for new maintainers and contributors, if you are interested in contributing please reach out to brancz (Frederic Branczyk) or lili (Lili Cosic) on Kubernetes slack. They have a few [help wanted issues as well](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

[PodUtils](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/pod-utilities.md#writing-a-prowjob-that-uses-pod-utilities) for Kubernetes testing have been [updated to support all metrics](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/4ijGaCCHVxQ), which means that you should use them for your tests in the future.  Test-infra has also [created an Overview screen](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Xy4RZAJ_u4E) in TestGrid.

SIG-ContribEx chair Jorge Castro [is stepping down](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/TYwMb3lbuyE), likely to be replaced by Alison Dowdney. Thank you to Jorge for being a true pillar of our community!

There will be no January Community Meeting, because of an error with the Kubernetes public calendar.  See you in February!

## Featured PRs

### [website#23294: [GSoD'20] Update how the Kubernetes website serves API references](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/23294)

As part of the Google Season of Docs for 2020, we have a massive revamp of the API documentation! The [primary reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/) now matches our standard style and more accessible to search engines. The new system also allows things like custom short URLs for commonly linked pages, better display for map and slice fields, and better documentation for API-adjacent types like TypeMeta and ObjectMeta. You can check out more information about the whole project [on the Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/04/gsod-2020-improving-api-reference-experience/).

### [enhancements#2310: Introduce KEP 2309: An IDL for Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2310)

While still under discussion, this KEP could use eyeballs from more corners of the Kubernetes community. The overall proposal is to create an IDL for Kubernetes types that can be compiled down to code for each language as well as CustomResourceDefinitions, allow depending on API types between projects without needing to align all dependencies, and generally making it easier to build high-quality Kubernetes types without needing 4 years of backstory in our Go, JSON, and Protobufs libraries. Check it out!

## Other Merges

* Structured log migration tally: [audit policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98252), [APIserver endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98093), [Windows proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97941)
* No more [panic in the Kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98200)
* Delete [static pods cleanly](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98103)
* Make inter-pod affinity affect scheduling more [by broadening the score range](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98096)
* `kubectl describe` [will now indent two spaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97946) for Resources, and `--dry-run=client` [acknowledges namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97492)
* Sort ReplicaSets by [revision, not timestamp](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97407) during cleanup
* Wanna disable volume stats?  [Set `--volume-stats-agg-period` to -1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96675)
* Fix race condition in shutting down EventRecorders, by [having them use select instead of spawning new goroutines](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95664)

## Removals

* API ExportOptions, deprecated a year ago, [are removed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98312) and queries that include them will get a 400
* Since `kubectl debug` is GA, [`kubectl alpha debug` is going away](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98111), incidentally [removing the last alpha command](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97523), meaning it's time for *you* to develop a new kubectl command
* Support for Windows containers under Hyper-V with Docker [has been removed as it never got beyond an experimental stage](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97141)

## Version Updates

* [cAdvisor to v0.37.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98015) in v1.19, and [to v0.38.7 in 1.20](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98014) to fix the [BtrFS bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/94335)
