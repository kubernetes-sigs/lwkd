* [**cloud-provider-aws v1.31.9**](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/releases/tag/v1.31.9) bumps the AWS Go SDK to 1.24.7 for CVE coverage, completes migration to AWS SDK v2 for EC2, ELB and ELBV2, adds support for a new AWS partition in the credential provider, and includes defensive fixes for potential nil pointer dereferences alongside the usual 1.31 release line version bump.
* [**cloud-provider-aws v1.30.10**](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/releases/tag/v1.30.10) mirrors the 1.31.9 line with backported updates to AWS SDK Go v2 (EC2 and load balancers), a Go SDK 1.24.7 security bump, support for the new AWS partition in credential provider logic, improved nil-pointer safety, and includes contributions from a new external maintainer.
* [**cloud-provider-aws v1.29.10**](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/releases/tag/v1.29.10) provides a straightforward version bump for the 1.29 branch, while [**cloud-provider-aws v1.29.9**](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws/releases/tag/v1.29.9) backports key changes including EC2/load balancer migration to AWS SDK Go v2, the Go SDK 1.24.7 CVE update, and new-partition support in the credential provider to keep older clusters aligned with current AWS environments.
* [**cluster-api v1.12.0-beta.1**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/tag/v1.12.0-beta.1) continues the v1.12 beta with chained-upgrade Runtime SDK improvements, blocking AfterClusterUpgrade hooks for safer rollouts, new features such as taint propagation in Machine APIs, MachineDeployment in-place update support, clusterctl describe condition filters, and a broad set of bugfixes and dependency bumps (including etcd v3.6.6 and Kubernetes v0.34.2 libraries).

* [**kubebuilder v4.10.1**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v4.10.1) is a fast follow-up bugfix release that retracts the problematic v4.10.0 Go module, fixes nested JSON tag `omitempty` handling in generated APIs, stabilizes metrics e2e tests with webhooks, and tightens Go module validation to prevent future module install issues while keeping scaffold auto-update guidance intact.
* [**kubebuilder v4.10.0**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/releases/tag/v4.10.0) (now retracted as a Go module) introduced the new `helm/v2-alpha` plugin to replace `helm/v1-alpha`, improved multi-arch support and Go/tooling versions (golangci-lint, controller-runtime, cert-manager), added external plugin enhancements (PluginChain, ProjectConfig access), support for custom webhook paths, and a series of CLI and scaffolding fixes including better handling of directories with spaces.
