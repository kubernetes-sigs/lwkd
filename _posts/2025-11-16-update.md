## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5067: Pod Generation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/5067-pod-generation#kep-5067-pod-generation)

This KEP introduces proper use of `metadata.generation` and a new `status.observedGeneration` field to show which PodSpec version the kubelet has actually processed. This helps eliminate uncertainty when multiple updates occur, making Pod status tracking consistent with other Kubernetes resources.

This KEP is tracked for stable in v1.35
