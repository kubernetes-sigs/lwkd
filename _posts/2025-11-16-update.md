## Developer News

Kubernetes SIG Network and the Security Response Committee [have announced the upcoming retirement of Ingress NGINX](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/11/11/ingress-nginx-retirement/). Best-effort maintenance will continue until March 2026.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature blogs ready for review, November 24th** 

We are in **Code Freeze**.  Release lead Drew Hagen [shared the state of the release](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/pS5PA3if3bk).

The Feature blog is a great way to highlight and share information about your enhancement with the community. Feature blogs are especially encouraged for high visibility changes as well as deprecations and removals. The official deadline has passed, but but opt-ins are still welcome. If you are interested in writing a blog for your enhancement, please create placeholder PR and contact your lead ASAP.

Kubernetes [v1.35.0-beta.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.35.md#v1350-beta0) and patch releases [v1.32.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md#v13210), [v1.31.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md#v13114) [v1.33.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md#v1336) and [v1.34.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md#v1342) are now live!

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5067: Pod Generation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/5067-pod-generation#kep-5067-pod-generation)

This KEP introduces proper use of `metadata.generation` and a new `status.observedGeneration` field to show which PodSpec version the kubelet has actually processed. This helps eliminate uncertainty when multiple updates occur, making Pod status tracking consistent with other Kubernetes resources.

This KEP is tracked for stable in v1.35
