## Developer News

The call for [Contributor Summit Sessions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfndK6hEDUQlC75_fol0NotaK_FrSC1D1EB-GTP3AsLpRecjw/viewform) is still open, for your discussion, workshop, or SIG meeting.

The legacy Linux package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io AKA packages.cloud.google.com) have been frozen starting from September 13, 2023 and are going away in January 2024, users must migrate.
If a cluster is running a Kubernetes Version older than 1.24. and is relying on the k8s upstream Linux package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io AKA packages.cloud.google.com) the cluster might be affected.
More Information can be found in the [Kubernetes.io Blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/31/legacy-package-repository-deprecation/).

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3715: Elastic Indexed Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3715-elastic-indexed-job)

Currently `spec.completions` is an immutable field for Jobs with both `Indexed` and `NonIndexed` completion modes. This KEP proposes to allow mutating the `spec.completions` field for `Indexed` Jobs when `spec.completions` equals to `spec.parallelism`. With this, we can handle cases which requires autoscaled indexed jobs. While such workloads can be modeled as StatefulSets, the Job API is better suited because of its features like allowing indexes to run to completion and better error handling. The KEP also describes in detail how the success and failure semantics are changed in the cases where `spec.completions` is mutated.

This KEP is targeting to graduate to stable state in the upcoming v1.30 release.
