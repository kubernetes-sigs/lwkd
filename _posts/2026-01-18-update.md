[KEP-5295: Introducing KYAML, a safer, less ambiguous YAML subset / encoding](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/5295-kyaml/README.md)

This KEP proposes introducing KYAML, a new kubectl output format that is a strict, safer subset of YAML designed to avoid common YAML pitfalls. KYAML is not whitespace-sensitive, making it easier to edit and patch reliably, especially in tools like Helm. The proposal also recommends making KYAML the standard format for Kubernetes documentation and examples. The motivation is to reduce errors caused by indentation, implicit type coercion, and other confusing YAML behaviors while still remaining compatible with existing YAML tooling.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
