## Developer News

SIG Windows is [nominating](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/SBBJIyOk2hE) Yuanliang Zhang and Jose Valdes as the new co-chairs. Aravindh Puthiyaparambil and Mark Rossetti will be stepping down from their roles as co-chairs while Mark Rossetti will continue on as technical lead. Thank you for your service and congrats to the newly elected chairs!

Patrick Ohly has [proposed to spin down WG Structured Logging](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/yNxsKwle80U) since most of the work has moved to different SIGs now. Thanks everyone who has helped modernizing logging in Kubernetes!

The SIG Node KEP Wrangling program [is looking for volunteers](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/sig-node/c/zacf1UWw8bg) for the v1.36 release. Sign up if you're interested to work with KEP authors and SIG leads to ensure that deadlines are met and KEPs progress in a timely manner for the v1.36 release. Please reach out in the [#sig-node-wranglers](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C092ZDBRU64) channel in Slack if you have any questions.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, February 4**

[Kubernetes v1.36 call for enhancements](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/mlVy85VxR_k) is open! If you want your KEP to go in the v1.36 cycle, talk to your SIG leads and get the lead-opted-in label. Make sure that your KEP meets the [PRR freeze requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#prr-freeze) before February 4th.

The January 2026 patch releases [remain delayed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Ffz6xyPf3xw) since the Go team issued new security releases, and the team is now wrapping up the necessary updates before cutting the patches.

## Featured PRs

* [136086: Graduate watch_list_duration_seconds to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136086)

This PR graduates the `watch_list_duration_seconds` metric from Alpha to Beta, signaling stability and long-term support. The metric provides improved observability into watch list performance and is now suitable for broader production use and alerting.

* [136117: Add utilities to allow strategy.go files to enable DV native validations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136117)

This PR adds utilities that allow Kubernetes API strategy implementations to opt into Declarative Validation (DV) native rules. It strengthens API correctness by ensuring declarative validations are consistently enforced for new APIs while preserving feature gate semantics.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5295: Introducing KYAML, a safer, less ambiguous YAML subset / encoding](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/5295-kyaml/README.md)

This KEP proposes introducing KYAML, a new kubectl output format that is a strict, safer subset of YAML designed to avoid common YAML pitfalls. KYAML is not whitespace-sensitive, making it easier to edit and patch reliably, especially in tools like Helm. The proposal also recommends making KYAML the standard format for Kubernetes documentation and examples. The motivation is to reduce errors caused by indentation, implicit type coercion, and other confusing YAML behaviors while still remaining compatible with existing YAML tooling.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
