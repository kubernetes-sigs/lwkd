## Featured PRs

* [136086: Graduate watch_list_duration_seconds to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136086)

This PR graduates the `watch_list_duration_seconds` metric from Alpha to Beta, signaling stability and long-term support. The metric provides improved observability into watch list performance and is now suitable for broader production use and alerting.

* [136117: Add utilities to allow strategy.go files to enable DV native validations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136117)

This PR adds utilities that allow Kubernetes API strategy implementations to opt into Declarative Validation (DV) native rules. It strengthens API correctness by ensuring declarative validations are consistently enforced for new APIs while preserving feature gate semantics.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5295: Introducing KYAML, a safer, less ambiguous YAML subset / encoding](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/5295-kyaml/README.md)

This KEP proposes introducing KYAML, a new kubectl output format that is a strict, safer subset of YAML designed to avoid common YAML pitfalls. KYAML is not whitespace-sensitive, making it easier to edit and patch reliably, especially in tools like Helm. The proposal also recommends making KYAML the standard format for Kubernetes documentation and examples. The motivation is to reduce errors caused by indentation, implicit type coercion, and other confusing YAML behaviors while still remaining compatible with existing YAML tooling.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
