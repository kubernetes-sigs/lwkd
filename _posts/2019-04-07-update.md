## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.15 Release Cycle begins April 8**

The new release cycle has begun, and the [release team is being staffed up](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/issues/545). Release Lead Claire Laurence has set an 11-week target for this release, aiming for final on June 18th in order to avoid clashing with Kubecon Shanghai and the July 4th holiday.

The 1.14.1 patch release came out Monday with an assortment of bug fixes for the new version.  Update your servers.

## Featured PRs

### [#74877: add go module support, manage vendor directory using go modules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/74877)

As a follow up to [#75595](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75595) last week, more module-y goodness is here. Hopefully this will be faster and more stable! If you commonly manipulate the dependencies, make sure to check out the new `hack/pin-dependency.sh` script which helps in pinning a specific SHA for a given package. This also means that staging repos will contain a `go.mod` file as well.

### [#75953: Expose etcd client latency metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75953)

This PR re-adds the same etcd latency metrics as we had back in the etcd v2 codepaths. This can be useful both for debugging api-server issues and changes to etcd, as well as general performance monitoring.

### [test-infra#12038: Automatically push all variants of all test images](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/12038)

Now pushing all of the test images will no longer need to be done manually by Google folks! Previously a lot of the automation for our images required some level of manual action by a Google employee, now the bulk of the work can be handled by our CI system and Google Cloud Build.

### [website#13543: Init Spanish translation](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/13543)

On the heels of German last week, this week we have Spanish! If you're interested in helping out with any website or documentation localization, now is a great time to get involved and help make our resources available to even more people.
