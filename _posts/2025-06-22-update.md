## Developer News

Having completed their work, [WG-Policy is being archived](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8489).  Congrats Policy team!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Open Doc Placeholders, July 3**

With [70 enhancements tracked](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/213/views/1), it's time to wrap up work on those changes.  The next step is opening a Docs placeholder PR so that the Docs team knows that you'll be ready by Docs deadline on Jul 29.  Didn't get your Enhancement approved in time?  You have until July 7th to [request an exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#exceptions).

Patch releases [v1.33.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md), [1.32.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md), [1.31.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md) and [1.30.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md) are released, including [a security update for Golang](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/132267).  This is likely to be the *last* patch release for Kubernetes 1.30, so users on that version should plan to upgrade soon.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 4800: Split UncoreCache Topology Awareness in CPU Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4800-cpumanager-split-uncorecache/README.md)

This KEP introduced a new static policy `prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache` for the CPU Manager that groups CPU resources by uncore cache where possible. An uncore cache refers to the cache that exists at a shared level among CPU cores. This is primarily beneficial for CPU architectures that utilize multiple uncore caches, or split uncore caches, within the processor.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
