## Developer News

The `kind/design` tag is being [retired in favor of `kind/feature`](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/f6W68eS8xo0) for most repositories.  `kind/design` was created as a label for a Kubernetes feature workflow that has been replaced by the Enhancements process, and as such is mostly just confusing today.  If your repo still actively uses `kind/design`, you must opt-in to keep it after Sept. 27.

Verónica López is now a [full Release Manager](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/U8v-pYOw3bQ) in the release-engineering group.  

WG K8s Infra [should be SIG K8s Infra](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/FelvVkgbQrw) by the time you read this.  On the other hand, WG Component Standard is [being dissolved](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/_IN6H0m_QHk) due to lack of participation.  During its time, WG-CS created the [Component Base repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/component-base) which will be managed by SIG-Arch.

SIG Leads can now [manage changes to their SIG's google groups](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/DhPel8J8QiA).

The Prow team has added long-requested features to [enable editing release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/23473) and [transfer issues between repos](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/23153).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: All Exceptions due Nov. 1**

We are in the "feature development" phase of the release.  As you hack on your features, consider if they are [suitable for the Feature blog due Nov 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-u3kzOouB_DrQs2tCGIeCcuuqx3TyefqKF90FAD-2Q8/edit#gid=0); more info [from the Release Lead](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/9TAMqOEV-Qk).
