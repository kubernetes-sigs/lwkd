## Developer News

Lots of news for you this week, starting with [the 1.23 release](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/12/07/kubernetes-1-23-release-announcement/)([release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#changelog-since-v1220)). SLSA compliance, Dual Stack, FlexVolume deprecation, PodSecurity API and more.  Note that the new version of cri-tools is not yet available, which means that some people should wait to upgrade.

Second, this will be the last LWKD in 2021, due to the holidays.  Publication will resume in January.

The [Contributor Celebration](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/) is this week.

The `kubernetes-dev` mailing list [will be moving to an @kubernetes.io address](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/jiFUzxqFXro) over the holidays, partly in order to fix the community calendar. You should not need to do anything immediately except change your personal address book entry.  In 2022, we will be asking document owners to switch document sharing to the new list.

Aldo Culquicondor wants to create a [Batch Working Group](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/NZq744NzwWw).  SIG-Release will be closing discussion on the [SLSA KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3051) and [signing KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3061) on Dec. 17th, so get your questions in now.  

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.24 cycle begins, January 2022**
