## Developer News

James Sturtevant and Amim Knabben are stepping down from their roles as techincal leads in [SIG Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows) and Yuanliang Zhang is notimated as the new Lead

Wenjia Zhang has stepped down as the co-chair of Kubernetes [SIG etcd](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md). [Siyuan Zhang](https://github.com/siyuanfoundation) is nominated to take over Wenjia's role as the co-chair.

SIG Contributor Experience has updated the [help-wanted guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8447) to remove the "low barrier to entry" requirement. This improves the distinction between "good first issue" and "help-wanted" and better aligns with other open source projects. The help-wanted issues still require clear tasks, goldilocks priority and must be up-to-date.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: v1.34 cycle starts May 19**

The v1.34 release cycle has officially started this week, with a planned release date of 27th August. 

Patch releases [v1.33.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md), [1.32.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md), [1.31.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md) and [1.30.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md) are available. This is mostly a bugfix release, with a golang update.

## Featured PRs

[131299: DRA: prevent admin access claims from getting duplicate devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131299)

This PR fixes a bug where ResourceClaims with `adminAccess` could be allocated the same device multiple times within a single claim; The DRA allocator now checks that each device is used only once per claim, preventing invalid CDI specs and ensuring correct behavior for device sharing with Dynamic Resource Allocation.

[131345: scheduler: return UnschedulableAndUnresolvable when node capacity is insufficient](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131345)

This PR updates the `NodeResourcesFit` plugin to return UnschedulableAndUnresolvable when a pod’s resource requests exceed a node’s allocatable capacity, even if the node is empty; This avoids unnecessary preemption attempts for nodes that can never satisfy the request, improves scheduling efficiency in large clusters, and provides clearer signals for unschedulable pods.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 4247: Per-plugin callback functions for efficient requeueing in the scheduling queue](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/4247-queueinghint/README.md)

This KEP introduced the `QueueingHint` functionality to the Kubernetes scheduler, enabling plugins to provide more precise suggestions for when to requeue Pods. By filtering out low-impact events such as unnecessary Node updates for `NodeAffinity` the scheduler reduced redundant retries and improved scheduling throughput. The KEP also allowed plugins like the DRA plugin to skip backoff in specific cases, enhancing performance for Pods requiring dynamic resource allocation by avoiding unnecessary delays while waiting for device driver updates.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.34.
