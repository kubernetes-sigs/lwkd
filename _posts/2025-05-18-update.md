## Developer News

James Sturtevant and Amim Knabben are stepping down from their roles as techincal leads in [SIG Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-windows) and Yuanliang Zhang is notimated as the new Lead

Wenjia Zhang has stepped down as the co-chair of Kubernetes [SIG etcd](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md). [Siyuan Zhang](https://github.com/siyuanfoundation) is nominated to take over Wenjia's role as the co-chair.

Kubernetes has released multiple minor versions including [v1.33.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md), [1.32.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md), [1.31.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.31.md) and [1.30.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md).

SIG Contributor Experience has updated the [help-wanted guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8447) to remove the "low barrier to entry" requirement. This improves the distinction between "good first issue" and "help-wanted" and better aligns with other open source projects. The help-wanted issues still require clear tasks, goldilocks priority and must be up-to-date.


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: v1.34 cycle starts May 19**


## Featured PRs
[131299: DRA: prevent admin access claims from getting duplicate devices](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131299)

This PR fixes a bug where ResourceClaims with `adminAccess` could be allocated the same device multiple times within a single claim; The DRA allocator now checks that each device is used only once per claim, preventing invalid CDI specs and ensuring correct behavior for device sharing with Dynamic Resource Allocation.


[131345: scheduler: return UnschedulableAndUnresolvable when node capacity is insufficient](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131345)

This PR updates the `NodeResourcesFit` plugin to return UnschedulableAndUnresolvable when a pod’s resource requests exceed a node’s allocatable capacity, even if the node is empty; This avoids unnecessary preemption attempts for nodes that can never satisfy the request, improves scheduling efficiency in large clusters, and provides clearer signals for unschedulable pods.
