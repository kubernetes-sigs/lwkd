## Developer News

The call for [Contributor Summit Sessions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfndK6hEDUQlC75_fol0NotaK_FrSC1D1EB-GTP3AsLpRecjw/viewform) is still open, for your discussion, workshop, or SIG meeting.

The legacy Linux package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io AKA packages.cloud.google.com) have been frozen starting from September 13, 2023 and are going away in January 2024. Clusters running versions older than 1.24 and relying on the k8s project Linux package repositories (apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io AKA packages.cloud.google.com) will be affected. See the [blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2023/08/31/legacy-package-repository-deprecation/).

WG-LTS [upgrade survey](http://bit.ly/k8s-upgrade-survey) is open until the end of January, please fill it out if you haven't already.

Antonio Ojea is now a Tech Lead for [SIG-Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-network/README.md).

## Featured PRs

[#122738: feature(gate): Integrate Inject Feature Gate Instance into client-go for Kubernetes Components](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122738)

This PR aims to streamline the management of client-go features by registering them with the `DefaultFeatureGate` instance. It establishes a connection that allows client-go to perform feature checks using the same instance used for Kubernetes feature checks. Notably, this integration ensures that client features seamlessly align with the existing `--feature-gates` flag for Kubernetes components. 

To circumvent a potential dependency cycle between component-base and client-go, this PR involves maintaining parallel definitions of feature types and constants in both. The successful integration hinges on the inclusion of an adapter to pass Kubernetes' default feature gate instance to client-go.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3715: Elastic Indexed Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3715-elastic-indexed-job)

Currently `spec.completions` is an immutable field for Jobs with both `Indexed` and `NonIndexed` completion modes. This KEP proposes to allow mutating the `spec.completions` field for `Indexed` Jobs when `spec.completions` equals to `spec.parallelism`. With this, we can handle cases which require autoscaled indexed jobs. While such workloads can be modeled as StatefulSets, the Job API is better suited because of its features like allowing indexes to run to completion and better error handling. The KEP also describes in detail how the success and failure semantics are changed in the cases where `spec.completions` is mutated.

This KEP is targeting to graduate to stable state in the upcoming v1.30 release.
