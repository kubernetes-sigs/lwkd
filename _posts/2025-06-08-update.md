## Featured PRs

[131632: feat: Allow leases to have custom labels set when a new holder takes the lease](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131632)

This PR allows users to set custom labels on LeaseLock resources when a new holder acquires the lease; users can now track which node holds the lease, thus improving observability for components using leader election.
