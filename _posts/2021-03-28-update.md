## Developer News


The `kubernetes/cluster-registry` project [has been archived](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/1499).  The original Registry concept was found by SIG-Multicluster to be unworkable, and has been replaced with a new project.

Reminder that if you're a SIG Lead you need to [take Bias Training](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4940); expect to hear from the SC if you're still postponing it.

SIG-Scalability [shared a SIG update](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M81X3_SWwHrJaWdJsecJReOVNxjjWSBFBkhPKEV35hs/edit?ts=605b3e97#slide=id.g401c104a3c_0_0).  Particularly, they're looking for help with a streamlined scalability test process.

And ... the KEP to move to 3 releases per year [is now open for comment](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2567).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Complete Docs and Feature Blog entries due March 31st**

We're almost done with 1.21, so it's [been branched](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/EHRzJxnlpGI), which means that any fixes you have for this release need to be cherry-picked.

We're in both Code Freeze and Test Freeze, and I can no longer feel my fingers.  I hope yours are nimble, though, because you should be writing away right now, finishing any doc edits and writing a paragraph for the release day blog if you have a new feature.
