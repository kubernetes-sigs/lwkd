## Developer News

Kubernetes is auditing and cleaning up inactive GitHub organization members in the first week of July 2025 to ensure active and accurate community representation. Contributors who are still active but not tracked by Dev-Stats can request an exception by commenting on the [cleanup issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5665) before the deadline on July 18, 2025.

The KubeCon North America 2025 Project [Lightning Talk and Maintainer Track](https://sessionize.com/project-lightning-talk-maintainer-track-na25) CFP is now open and closes soon on July 7th. Make sure to submit your talks before the deadline!

[Ongoing discussion in the Kubernetes community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/8490) regarding Slack migration is closed now. Since Salesforce has postponed the downgrade. Any future conversations about potential migration will take place later on a more relaxed timeline.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Blog Placeholders, July 11th**

[1.34-alpha.2 was released this week](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md#v1340-alpha2), in case you want to play around with the new version.

## Featured PRs

[12937: feature(kubectl): support --cpu, --memory flag to kubectl autoscale](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/129373)

This PR introduces support for the `--cpu` and `--memory` flags in the kubectl autoscale command; The new flags allow users to specify **CPU** and **Memory** metrics for horizontal pod autoscaling; The update supports both percentage-based utilization and fixed resource values, thus streamlining resource management; This PR also deprecates the `--cpu-percent` flag, following the new approach for defining resource targets.

[132351: bugfix(hpa): introduce buildQuantity helper for consistent resource quantity](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/132351)

This PR introduces the buildQuantity helper function in the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) controller to ensure consistent handling of resource quantities; Before this change, resource quantities were created inline, which causes inconsistencies in handling CPU and memory metrics; With this update, the buildQuantity function standardizes the process by converting raw memory values to KiB and use BinarySI and handling CPU and other resources in milli-units with DecimalSI; Memory metrics are now displayed correctly in `Ki`, instead of incorrectly appending the “m” suffix thus improving consistency in metric calculations and display.

[131837: Deny pod admission for static pods referencing API objects](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/131837)

Static pods that reference API objects are now denied admission by the kubelet. This is to prevent static pods silently running even after the mirror pod creation fails. Currently, mirror pod reconciliation for static pods which reference API objects will fail. However the pod itself is not denied admission and the node would be silently running the static pod's container. A new feature gate `PreventStaticPodAPIReferences` is introduced to enable stricter validation for static pods. Enabling this feature gate ensures that the static pod container is not created when the mirror pod creation fails.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-3902: Decouple Taint-based Pod Eviction from Node Lifecycle Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/3902-decoupled-taint-manager/README.md)

This KEP splits the existing NodeLifecycleController into two controllers: `NodeLifecycleController` (to add taints to unhealthy nodes) and `TaintEvictionController` (to evict pods from tainted nodes). Previously, both tainting and eviction were handled by a single controller, but the main goal of this change is to separate responsibilities for better clarity, organization, and maintainability. The new TaintEvictionController is created from existing taint-manager code and now runs separately. A feature gate called `SeparateTaintEvictionController` lets you enable or disable the new setup. From Kubernetes v1.29, the taint-based eviction is still enabled by default, but cluster admins can disable the default TaintEvictionController using the `--controllers=-taint-eviction-controller` flag in kube-controller-manager if needed.

This KEP is tracked as stable in v1.34.
