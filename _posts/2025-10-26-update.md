## Developer News

The steering committee election voting period closed last week. The results will be announced in the public steering meeting next Wednesday.

Some reminders for folks attending KubeCon NA 2025 about the [Kubernetes Contributor Hour and the SIG/WG Meet and Greet](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/eeyzDwxIz4M)

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, 7th November**

With the feature blog freeze in place, KEP assignees are expected to open placeholder PRs for their blogs. Please reach out to the Release Comms team for more information. We're one week away from the v1.35 code freeze. Get your PRs ready and don't forget to file an early exception if you anticipate any delays!

October patch releases [have been skipped altogether](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/g6TibFkr80U).

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5007: DRA: Device Binding Conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/5007-device-attach-before-pod-scheduled/README.md)

This KEP introduces BindingConditions, enabling the scheduler to delay Pod binding until external resources such as fabric-attached GPUs or FPGAs are confirmed ready. This improves scheduling reliability by preventing premature bindings that could lead to Pod failures or require manual intervention. The mechanism also supports asynchronous or failure-prone scenarios, including remote accelerators and FPGA reprogramming.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.35.

## Other Merges

* DRA resources use eachKey [declarative validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134836) to mirror map-key checks and keep generated DV in sync with handwritten rules
* [CSI NodePublishVolumeRequest](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134826) now carries pod service account tokens in the gRPC secrets field instead of volume_context
* [DRA DeviceAttribute](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134824) now declares its non-discriminated union with +k8s:unionMember, so declarative validation can enforce “exactly one value set” 
* [Add +k8s:maxLength (and +k8s:optional) to NetworkDeviceData](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134807) so generated DV can cap interfaceName / hardwareAddress lengths and match handwritten validation
* [Wire storage.k8s.io (StorageClass)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134796) into declarative validation and mark provisioner as +k8s:required, so generated DV now matches the old handwritten strategy on create/update
* [StorageVersionMigration (SVM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134784) graduates to v1beta1 and drops the old v1alpha1/unused fields, so clusters must clean up any storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1 SVM objects before upgrading
* [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134782) finally drops support for the long-deprecated `certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1 CertificateSigningRequest`.
* Add `mtlsclient` and `mtlsserver` for the [mtls validations](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134778)
* `apiserver` cacher’s [lister_watcher](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134770) now exposes WatchList semantics
* Enable [declarative validation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134767) for `resource.k8s.io` ResourceSlice (v1/v1beta1/v1beta2)
* Introduce `pod queuing` in [endpoint/slice controllers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134739)
* Add [`k8s-resource-fully-qualified-name`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134602/files) format
* Implements [synthetic create authz permission](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134577) check for exec, attach, and portforward
* Enable Declarative Validation(DV) support for [ClusterRole and RoleBinding](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134537)
* Replace HandleCrash and HandleError calls to use [context-aware alternative](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134450)
* Bump supported etcd version to [v3.5.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134779) for release v1.32, v1.33, and v1.3

## Promotions

* [Pod Generation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134948) to GA
* [ContainerRestartRules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134631) to beta
* [RelaxedServiceNameValidation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134493) to beta
* [PreferSameTrafficDistribution](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134457) to GA

## Version Updates

* etcd sdk to [v3.6.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134780)
* [system-validators](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134744) to v1.12.1

## Subprojects and Dependency Updates

* [**containerd v2.2.0-rc.0**](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc.0) *(pre-release)* adds a mount manager, supports `conf.d` includes in the default config, and adds back-references in the garbage collector. It improves CRI with ListPodSandboxMetrics and image-volume subpaths, adds parallel image unpack and a referrers fetcher, updates EROFS snapshotter, enables OTEL traces and WASM plugin support in NRI, speeds shim reloads, and postpones some deprecations to 2.3.

* [**containerd API v1.10.0-rc.0**](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/api/v1.10.0-rc.0) *(pre-release)* aligns with containerd 2.2, introducing the mount manager and parallel unpack support in the API.

* [**prometheus v3.7.3**](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.7.3) fixes a UI redirect regression with `-web.external-url` and `-web.route-prefix`, corrects federation for some native histograms, fixes a `promtool check config` failure when `--lint=none` is set, and resolves a remote-write queue resharding deadlock.
