## Subprojects and Dependency Updates

* [**containerd v2.2.0-rc.0**](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.2.0-rc.0) *(pre-release)* adds a mount manager, supports `conf.d` includes in the default config, and adds back-references in the garbage collector. It improves CRI with ListPodSandboxMetrics and image-volume subpaths, adds parallel image unpack and a referrers fetcher, updates EROFS snapshotter, enables OTEL traces and WASM plugin support in NRI, speeds shim reloads, and postpones some deprecations to 2.3.

* [**containerd API v1.10.0-rc.0**](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/api/v1.10.0-rc.0) *(pre-release)* aligns with containerd 2.2, introducing the mount manager and parallel unpack support in the API.

* [**prometheus v3.7.3**](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.7.3) fixes a UI redirect regression with `-web.external-url` and `-web.route-prefix`, corrects federation for some native histograms, fixes a `promtool check config` failure when `--lint=none` is set, and resolves a remote-write queue resharding deadlock.
