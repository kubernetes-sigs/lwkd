## Other Merges

* DRA resources use eachKey [declarative validation(https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134836) to mirror map-key checks and keep generated DV in sync with handwritten rules
* [CSI NodePublishVolumeRequest](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134826) now carries pod service account tokens in the gRPC secrets field instead of volume_context
* [DRA DeviceAttribute](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134824) now declares its non-discriminated union with +k8s:unionMember, so declarative validation can enforce “exactly one value set” 
* [Add +k8s:maxLength (and +k8s:optional) to NetworkDeviceData](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134807) so generated DV can cap interfaceName / hardwareAddress lengths and match handwritten validation
* [Wire storage.k8s.io (StorageClass)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134796) into declarative validation and mark provisioner as +k8s:required, so generated DV now matches the old handwritten strategy on create/update
* [StorageVersionMigration (SVM)](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134784) graduates to v1beta1 and drops the old v1alpha1/unused fields, so clusters must clean up any storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1 SVM objects before upgrading
* [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134782) finally drops support for the long-deprecated `certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1 CertificateSigningRequest`.
