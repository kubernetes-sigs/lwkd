## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5007: DRA: Device Binding Conditions](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/5007-device-attach-before-pod-scheduled/README.md)

This KEP introduces BindingConditions, enabling the scheduler to delay Pod binding until external resources such as fabric-attached GPUs or FPGAs are confirmed ready. This improves scheduling reliability by preventing premature bindings that could lead to Pod failures or require manual intervention. The mechanism also supports asynchronous or failure-prone scenarios, including remote accelerators and FPGA reprogramming.

This KEP is tracked for beta in v1.35.
