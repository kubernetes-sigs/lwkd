## Developer News

Eddie Zane of SIG-CLI [started a discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/y4Q20V3dyOk) around plans to make it a tad more difficult to accidentally delete your entire cluster.  Read the thread for some good discussion and comment if you need to.

v1.18.19 contains [a regression](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102489).  If you are still on version 1.18, and have not yet upgraded to 1.18.19, SIG-Release advises you not to update at this time.  Release Engineering is tentatively planning on doing one additional final patch to 1.18 with the other patch releases this month instead.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Feature Exceptions Due, June 28th**

It's still feature-hacking period, so if you're not actively hacking on a feature (or even if you are), now is a good time to [fix some flaky tests](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/zPySWW09j9I).  This week SIG-API-Machinery, SIG-Storage, and SIG-Cloud-Provider own our new flakes, so if y'all could take a look at those that would be great. With 6 blocking tests flaking, and 13 informing tests not passing, this is gonna be one sloooow release cycle if we don't get those fixed.

Cherry-picks for patch releases are due June 12th for a June 16th release.  This will *probably* include an additional release in the 1.18 series, 1.18.20, because of the regression introduced with 1.18.19; that patch will reverse the regression and nothing more. Regardless, 1.18 users should really really plan to upgrade ASAP because there will be no further patches in that version.
