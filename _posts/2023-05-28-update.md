## Featured PRs

### [ LegacyServiceAccountTokenCleanUp alpha #115554 ](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115554)

[Bound service account tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/1205-bound-service-account-token) went GA in 1.22, and are the current and more secure way to allocate service tokens. However, automated generation of the older secret-based tokens is still enabled, and production clusters will have a lot of old tokens still stored. [KEP 2799](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token) cleans this up, ending auto-generation of old tokens. This PR implements a purge of of the old tokens if enabled using the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenCleanUp` feature gate.  By 1.30 or so, expect it to be on by default.
