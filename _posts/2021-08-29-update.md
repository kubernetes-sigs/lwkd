## Developer News

Kubernetes/kubernetes main is now [using Go v1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/23358). This will require you to [rebase any open PRs](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/5kiB72M8518).

Please [register](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcsna2021/) for the Contributor Summit if you plan to attend, either in person or virtually!  We are trying to plan activities around the Summit, and we need to know how many people are coming.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Sept. 9th**

Make sure to add your feature to the [Enhancements Sheet](https://bit.ly/k8s123-enhancements) as soon as you're ready, and no later than Sept. 9th. Note that the PRR team wants your Production Review questionnaires by Sept. 2nd.  At this time, we have *zero* tracked enhancements, so at least some of you are holding back.

The cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is Sept. 10, for a probable release on Sept. 15.
