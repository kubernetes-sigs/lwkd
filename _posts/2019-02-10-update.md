First, make sure you patch all of your nodes against the [runc vulnerability](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/02/11/2) announced today.  No matter which container runtime you're using, you need to update it.  

Also, due to a vandalism attack on our most popular Slack channels, admins had to temporarily close Kubernetes Slack to new user registrations last Sunday. We will announce a way to sign up for Slack accounts once there is a more juvenile-delinquent-resistant one. In the meantime, please use [Discuss](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/) or Stack Overflow to ask questions.

## Community Meeting Summary

We kicked off the [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) with a demo of the recently released [CodeReady Workspaces](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EJogPeRGcTAeuEssh-h500M4cLOxtIam/view) by Mario Loriedo and Stevan Le Meur.  They showed off modifying and sharing a container image of a development environment to allow collaborative work.

[SIG-Instrumentation's recent work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KzYZCf5VUMp65H_vlPwg7AD4UIXWTRtiUK34L1GYOqE/edit#slide=id.p) included a revamp of kube-state-metrics and a [complete overhaul of metrics in general](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/0031-kubernetes-metrics-overhaul.md), which will cause a deprecation of old metrics in 1.14 and removing them in 1.15.  After this, the goal is to have a stable API for metrics.  

Speaking of KEPs, [SIG-PM has been hard at work](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A3xvBhMqjuPu183RFVSBZptm9hz-_Qz24XzZu14Qsoc/edit#slide=id.g401c104a3c_0_0) making KEPs into an integral part of the Kubernetes development process.  This includes a beta spec, [new template](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/0000-kep-template.md), new labels, and the [requirement to use them for 1.14 enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/0001-kubernetes-enhancement-proposal-process.md).  They'll continue to iterate on that, including introducing a CLI tool and trying to dump the Enhancements tracking spreadsheet.

SIG-Cluster-Lifecycle has prepared a nice [grooming document](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-cluster-lifecycle/grooming.md) for how they prioritize their work for each release, and are sharing it as a potential template for other SIGs.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: create 1.14 branch and release beta, Feb. 12th**

Last week was [week 5 of 1.14](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.14), putting us more than halfway to code freeze (reminder: no code slush this time).  All of the enhancements have been filed, 20 alpha features, 13 beta and 6 stable promotions.

There were no patch releases last week, or scheduled for this week.  

## Featured PRs

### [#72947: Merge feature-serverside-apply back in master](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72947)

Server-side apply has finally (mostly) landed! Up until now, all the logic for `kubectl apply` has lived in Kubectl itself, making it very difficult to use from other places like custom controllers or CLI tools. By moving the logic to the API server, `apply` functionality is now easily available to all clients. This also dramatically improves the behavior of `apply` when working with multiple competing controllers, such as the case of an object uploaded via `kubectl apply` but also being updated by Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

The LWKD team would like to extend out personal congratulations to the whole SSA team and SIG-APIMachinery, it was a long road but you all made it happen!

### [test-infra#11135: Add postmortem for 2019-02-05 partial outage](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11135)

Did you know that SIG-Testing publishes outage reports for Prow and Tide? Fortunately issues are infrequent and this outage only impacted a few PRs, but it's a great post-mortem report and worth a read if nothing else to have a better idea of how it all works.

### [community#3186: Update zoom guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3186)

Zoom is used by many SIGs and WGs for their weekly meetings, as well as for other video chats. This week sees a nice revamp of the documentation for working with Zoom for Kubernetes teams. As always, if you have any questions about our usage of Zoom, please contact the [Zoom admins](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/moderators.md#zoom) or anyone in SIG-ContribEx.

## Other Merges

* kubelet now sets [oom_score_adj](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73758) for pods marked as critical priority
* [Add `--all-namespaces`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73716) to `kubectl delete` in order to support purging CRD objects.
* Don't let the event watcher [go back in time](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73845), since that might cause a dangerous paradox.
* Kubeadm now [has a preflight check for cgroup drivers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73837).
* `kubelet_node_name` is [now a metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72910), helping join stats from multiple sources, and `usageNanoCores` is [a kubelet stat too](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73659)
* [Fix execute permissions](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73533) for fsGroups
* Docker metrics [have been made compliant](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72323), as part of the general metrics standardization
* `set env` on a local resource won't [trigger a panic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65636)

## Promotions

* [HugePages to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/72785)

## Deprecated

* The `kubeadm alpha preflight` command [is gone](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73718) 
* [Finish deleting deprecated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/73441) OpenAPI paths from the APIserver; you now need to use `openapi/v2` for everything
