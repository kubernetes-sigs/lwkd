## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Production Readiness Freeze, June 8**

We are now officially in the 1.28 cycle, and Release Lead Grace Nguyen [has a "sneak peek"](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/vUdKi_l6V50) for you. That also means that the Enhancements deadlines are coming soon (PRR: June 8, Enhancements: June 16); if you've forgotten how this all works, Atharva Shinde [has a primer](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/9S0kRAMQXFA). Short Version: decide what you'll finish for 1.28 in the next 3 weeks.

Patch releases for all supported versions are expected out this Wednesday.
