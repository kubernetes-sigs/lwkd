## Developer News

A new kubernetes-sigs project, [Node Readiness Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/node-readiness-controller), has been introduced to provide fine-grained, declarative control over node scheduling. The controller manages node taints based on custom node conditions, enabling multi-step node initialization workflows through NodeReadinessRule CRDs. It supports both bootstrap-only and continuous enforcement modes, includes a dryRun option for impact auditing, and works out-of-the-box with existing tooling such as Node Problem Detector and other condition-reporting daemons. Slack: `#sig-node-readiness-controller`
Documentation: [User Guide & Concepts](https://node-readiness-controller.sigs.k8s.io/)

SIG Instrumentation leadership has nominated Patrick Ohly (@pohly) as a new Tech Lead. Congratulations and thank you for your continued leadership and contributions.

SIG Release has announced a leadership update: Frederico Muñoz will join Kat Cosgrove as co-lead of the Release Team subproject. Thank you to all contributors who continue to grow into leadership roles across the project.

Annual report season is underway. SIGs are asked to submit their [annual reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8756) by February 28, highlighting key accomplishments from the past year and identifying areas or subprojects that need additional support. Reminder, reports don't have to be submitted by SIG/WG chairs, feel free to nominate candidates among your
contributors, this is a great way to grow your new leads.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, Feb 4; Enhancements Freeze, Feb 11**

The [Production Readiness Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#prr-freeze) is this week, so hopefully you've opted-in all your KEPs.  Next week is the final [Enhancements deadline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) for 1.36.

Because of multiple waits for critical fixes, [January and February patch releases](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/fkXitM-lNmw) are being combined.  Cherry picks are this Friday and the patch release will be next week.

## Featured PRs

* [136482: Graduate DeclarativeValidation feature gate to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136482)
This PR graduates the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate to GA in Kubernetes v1.36 and locks it to `true` by default. Declarative Validation is now a stable part of the API machinery, ensuring consistent, schema-driven validation generated from API definitions. The change also updates tests to use feature gate emulation where required, preventing failures now that the gate can no longer be disabled.

* [136643: Promote kubectl kuberc commands to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136643)
This PR promotes `kubectl kuberc` commands from alpha to beta, making them available outside the `kubectl alpha` namespace. As part of the promotion, comprehensive e2e tests were added to meet beta stability requirements. This improves the maturity and reliability of kubectl’s user preference management capabilities.

* [136619: DRA allocator: promote experimental → incubating → stable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136619)
This PR advances the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) allocator by promoting the previously incubating implementation to stable, while moving experimental code to incubating. Although this is a code-structure change with no direct user-facing impact, it marks an important internal milestone in stabilizing DRA components and clarifying their lifecycle stages for future development.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5073: Declarative Validation of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md)

This enhancement introduces a new code generator `validation-gen` to write validation logic sourced from the `types.go` files that define the Kubernetes native API types. A variety of [IDL tags](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md#catalog-of-supported-validation-rules--associated-idl-tags) have been introduced that are parsed by `validation-gen` and used to generate boilerplate validation logic that would otherwise have needed to be handwritten. For example, a `+k8s:minimum` comment can be used to enforce a numeric bound on a field without having to manually write bounds-checking logic.

This KEP is tracked for GA in v1.36.
