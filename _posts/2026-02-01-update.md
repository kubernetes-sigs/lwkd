## Developer News


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, Feb 4; Enhancements Freeze, Feb 11**

The [Production Readiness Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#prr-freeze) is this week, so hopefully you've opted-in all your KEPs.  Next week is the final [Enhancements deadline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) for 1.36.

Because of multiple waits for critical fixes, [January and February patch releases](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/fkXitM-lNmw) are being combined.  Cherry picks are this Friday and the patch release will be next week.

## Featured PRs

* [136482: Graduate DeclarativeValidation feature gate to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136482)
This PR graduates the `DeclarativeValidation` feature gate to GA in Kubernetes v1.36 and locks it to `true` by default. Declarative Validation is now a stable part of the API machinery, ensuring consistent, schema-driven validation generated from API definitions. The change also updates tests to use feature gate emulation where required, preventing failures now that the gate can no longer be disabled.

* [136643: Promote kubectl kuberc commands to beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136643)
This PR promotes `kubectl kuberc` commands from alpha to beta, making them available outside the `kubectl alpha` namespace. As part of the promotion, comprehensive e2e tests were added to meet beta stability requirements. This improves the maturity and reliability of kubectl’s user preference management capabilities.

* [136619: DRA allocator: promote experimental → incubating → stable](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136619)
This PR advances the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) allocator by promoting the previously incubating implementation to stable, while moving experimental code to incubating. Although this is a code-structure change with no direct user-facing impact, it marks an important internal milestone in stabilizing DRA components and clarifying their lifecycle stages for future development.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5073: Declarative Validation of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md)

This enhancement introduces a new code generator `validation-gen` to write validation logic sourced from the `types.go` files that define the Kubernetes native API types. A variety of [IDL tags](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md#catalog-of-supported-validation-rules--associated-idl-tags) have been introduced that are parsed by `validation-gen` and used to generate boilerplate validation logic that would otherwise have needed to be handwritten. For example, a `+k8s:minimum` comment can be used to enforce a numeric bound on a field without having to manually write bounds-checking logic.

This KEP is tracked for GA in v1.36.
