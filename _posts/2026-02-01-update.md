## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5073: Declarative Validation of Kubernetes Native Types With validation-gen](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md)

This enhancement introduces a new code generator `validation-gen` to write validation logic sourced from the `types.go` files that define the Kubernetes native API types. A variety of [IDL tags](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/5073-declarative-validation-with-validation-gen/README.md#catalog-of-supported-validation-rules--associated-idl-tags) have been introduced that are parsed by `validation-gen` and used to generate boilerplate validation logic that would otherwise have needed to be handwritten. For example, a `+k8s:minimum` comment can be used to enforce a numeric bound on a field without having to manually write bounds-checking logic.

This KEP is tracked for GA in v1.36.
