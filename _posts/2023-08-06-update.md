[KEP 3939 - Allow replacement of Pods in a Job when fully terminated](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3939-allow-replacement-when-fully-terminated)

This KEP adds a new field to the Kubernetes Jobs API which lets users specify if they want the pods of a job to be recreated as soon as the previous pods are terminating, or only once they’ve fully terminated. A job is considered to be failed as soon as the job’s pods are in terminating state. This KEP lets the user control this behaviour and let them mark the job as failed only after the pod has been terminated. This KEP adds two new API fields, one for configuring whether or not to wait for the terminating pods to finish before creating replacement pods, and another field in Status for tracking the number of terminating pods. This would ensure that the number of pods that are running in the cluster would be the same as what the user specifies at any given time, and hence prevent unnecessary scaling up of the cluster. This KEP was created on [April 4th, 2023 by Kevin Hannon](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3939) and is in alpha in the 1.28 release.

- Ingress NGINX now supports [configuring hostAliases property for pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/10180). This can be used to add hostnames to `/etc/hosts`.
- kubespray added [CPU management policies on the node](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/pull/10309). This static policy allows containers in guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests access to exclusive CPUs on the node.
- Prometheus added [push metrics command to promtool](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/pull/12299).
