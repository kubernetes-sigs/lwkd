## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.25 Released, August 23rd**

Kubernetes 1.25 has been release! Big congrats to everyone who worked on it. Check out the [blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/23/kubernetes-v1-25-release/) and [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md) for more information.

[1.24.4](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.10](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.13](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) came out last week.  This update fixes [JobTrackingWithFinalizers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111664) and a bunch of memory leaks, and [updates Golang](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111639).

## Reversions

* GCP and Azure in-tree auth plugins [have been replaced](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111918) in 1.25, to fix [an issue with exec](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/111911); they will be removed in 1.26
* Conditionally disabling compression [has been removed from 1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111896) due to [some concerns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111507#issuecomment-1218371898) from API-Machinery and Scalability; it may or may not reappear for 1.26
