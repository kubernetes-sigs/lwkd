[133604: Fix storage counting all objects instead of objects for resource](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133604)

This PR fixes a regression where `apiserver_storage_objects` was overcounted by counting all etcd objects (using `/registry`) instead of just the target resource (e.g., pods); It now counts only that resourceâ€™s objects, thus giving accurate per-resource metrics and avoiding extra work when the watch cache is disabled.
