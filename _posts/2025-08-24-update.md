[133604: Fix storage counting all objects instead of objects for resource](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133604)

This PR fixes a regression where apiserver_storage_objects overcounted by scanning /registry instead of the resource prefix (for example, pods); It now counts only that resourceâ€™s objects, giving accurate per-resource metrics and avoiding extra work when the watch cache is disabled.
