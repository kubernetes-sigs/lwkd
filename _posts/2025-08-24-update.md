## Developer News


## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Day 27th August**

Kubernetes v1.34 is released. 

A regression in kube-proxy v1.34.* that prevented startup on single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 hosts was identified and fixed ahead of release cut.
A huge thank you to all contributors, reviewers, and release team members whose efforts made this release possible!

The next scheduled patch releases are on September 9, 2025 (cherry pick deadline: September 5, 2025).
As a reminder, Kubernetes 1.31 will enter maintenance mode on August 28, 2025, with End of Life (EOL) planned for October 28, 2025.

## Featured PRs

[133604: Fix storage counting all objects instead of objects for resource](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133604)

This PR fixes a regression where `apiserver_storage_objects` was overcounted by counting all etcd objects (using `/registry`) instead of just the target resource (e.g., pods); It now counts only that resource’s objects, thus giving accurate per-resource metrics and avoiding extra work when the watch cache is disabled.


## KEP of the Week

[KEP 24: Add AppArmor Support](https://github.com/tallclair/k8s-enhancements/blob/3bfe4d0b1dcf20394fd2b2bc77ee50911b409fe8/keps/sig-node/24-apparmor/README.md)

This KEP introduces support for AppArmor within a cluster. AppArmor can enable users to run a more secure deployment, and/or provide better auditing and monitoring of their systems. The AppArmor support provides users an alternative to SELinux, and provides an interface for users that are already maintaining a set of AppArmor profiles. This KEP is proposing a minimal path to GA, per the no perma-Beta requirement.

This KEP is tracked for Stable in 1.34

## Shoutouts

* Christian Schlotter (@chrischdi): Thanks to Fabrizio Pandini (@fabrizio.pandini) and Stefan Büringer (@sbueringer) for the huge amount of work they did for the latest cluster api :cluster-api: v1.11.0 release to set the stage for the v1beta2 api version, which benefits all users to have a more clear and consistent API as well as a better feedback loop!
