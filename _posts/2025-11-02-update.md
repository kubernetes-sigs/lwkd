## Developer News

The 2025 Steering Committee Election [results are announced](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/j33wUVy4TuQ/m/Oj7RVfKRAAAJ). Congratulations to Kat Cosgrove, Paco Xu, Rita Zhang and Maciej Szulik for being elected for their 2 year term in steering. Thank you to all the candidates and all the community members for voting. An election retro call is happening on 19th November, 8AM PT. If you have any feedback about the steering elections this year, please add it to the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reycmc0N3CCB8JDnoAE7Hu6AhyATwTqrZ9Xdnmu5YBw/edit?usp=sharing).

[WG-LTS is winding down](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/NBuTR1FqnTs) after the conclusion from all the discussions that a community supported LTS within the Kubernetes project is probably not the right answer. The Compatibility Versions feature is cited as an alternative for doing safer upgrades.

The [Kustomize project is seeking proposals for a new logo](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/6004). If you have any ideas for a new logo, do post it in the open issue!

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, 7th November**\

The code freeze and test freeze deadline is on Friday 7th November 2025, 12:00 UTC. Please open an early exception for your KEP if you think you need more time!

Kubernetes [v1.35.0-alpha.3](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/4H67qKUI6eY) is live.

## Featured PRs

### [[KEP-4330] add min-compatibility-version to control plane](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/133980)

This PR is part of [a larger effort](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-architecture/4330-compatibility-versions?rgh-link-date=2025-04-18T19%3A45%3A43Z) to introduce "compatibility versions" to control plane components and features, eventually permitting upgrades and rollbacks that span more than one Kubernetes version safely.  This PR adds the field to apiserver, controller-manager, and scheduler.

## KEP of the Week

### [KEP-4827: Component Statusz](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/4827-component-statusz/README.md)

As part of Kubernetes march towards structured data for everything, this KEP introduces a structured, standardized endpoint for health and status checking.  It will enhance observability and enable building new monitoring and performance tools.  Statusz is kicking off [with v1alpha1 in 1.35](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/134313)
