### [#126745: Improve PVC protection controller's scalability by batch-processing PVCs by namespace & caching live pod list results [fixed dead loop issue with idle work queue]](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126745)

This PR significantly enhances the scalability of the PVC Protection Controller by implementing batch processing of PVCs by namespace and caching live pod list results. It resolves a critical dead loop issue in the idle work queue and addresses performance bottlenecks in large clusters by reducing the number of API calls required for PVC deletion. As a result, the kube-controller-manager's CPU usage is optimized, ensuring more efficient and reliable operation, especially in environments with high pod and PVC churn.
