## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Themes and Docs Complete, November 28**

Hopefully, you've debugged all of your features and are hard at work editing documentation, because those docs need to be edited and done in a week. Then on to the release! Please keep an eye out for and respond to any test failures during code freeze, as always.

Patch releases [1.28.4](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/k5HaLtE8jnM), [1.27.8](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/GLQ2R0e9OaE), [1.26.11](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/iHSD1DMNjd8) and [1.25.16](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-announce/c/CNZH-8Cn_n8) came out last week. This includes golang updates.


## Featured PRs


## KEP of the Week

### [KEP 3466 - Kubernetes Component SLIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/3466-kubernetes-component-health-slis)

This KEP proposes allowing emitting of SLI data in a structured manner. This is so that monitoring agents can scrape this data at a higher scrape interval and create SLOs (Service Level Objects) and alerts based on these SLIs (Service Level Indicators). The proposed solution for this is to add a new endpoint on Kubernetes components `/metrics/slis` which would return the SLI data in Prometheus format. This would help create a uniform interface by which we can consume health checking information and would allow SLIs to be created without a specialized monitoring agent.

This KEP was in alpha in the v1.26 release, and is currently tracked graduate to stable in the upcoming v1.29 release.
