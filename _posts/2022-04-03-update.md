## Developer News

Etcd 3.5.X has [a significant data corruption issue](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/13766), and is [not recommended for production use](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc).  If you have not yet upgraded to Etcd 3.5, please wait for 3.5.3.  If you have upgraded, you need to restart etcd with the `--experimental-initial-corrupt-check` flag.  Kubeadm [supports this flag](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109074).

The Steering Committee is [considering archiving SIG Service Catalog](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/QRcg6XacYRw) due to inactivity. If you use [minibroker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/minibroker/issues/256), [service-catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/issues/2913), or [go-open-service-broker](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/go-open-service-broker-client/issues/172) projects, please speak up on the linked issues about what you think should be done with that project.

[Kubernetes Contributor Summit EU](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcseu/) will be held on May 16th at the Fira in Valencia.  Registration and additional details coming soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Doc PRs ready for review, April 5th**

The first release candidate for 1.24 [has been postponed to next week](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/dYklbmFPZcw) due to a certificate validation error [we need to wait for go 1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108910) to be fixed.  As such, RC 0 will be released next Monday.

There's plenty to do this week while you wait for RC 0, though.  First, your draft documentation on your enhancements is due Tuesday.  At the same time, the Release Notes team will be drafting the notes, and asking you questions.  And the Release Blog will be finalized Wednesday.

The following test jobs are still flaky, and could easily cause the final release to be delayed, so look into them if you can: [skew-cluster-latest](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#skew-cluster-latest-kubectl-stable1-gce), [gce-ingress](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#gci-gce-ingress), [kind-master-parallel](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#kind-master-parallel), and [ci-kubernetes-unit](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking#ci-kubernetes-unit).  Check the [CI work board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/68/) to collaborate.

The cherry pick deadline for the next set of patch releases is April 8th.
