## Developer News

[CVE-2025-13281](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/135525): the in-tree Portworxs CSI driver exposes a security hole in the kube-controller-manager, which was [patched for other storage drivers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91542) but not for Portworx. Vulnerable users are ones who *still* haven't migrated to the external CSI StorageClass.  

SIG-Scheduling has [published their technical plan for Kubernetes 1.36](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZMtHBibXfTw4cQerM4O4DJonzVs3W7Hp2K5ml6pTufs/edit?usp=sharing_eip&ts=6920725d).

Wei Fu was [nominated as SIG-Etcd Tech Lead](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/e6OgfGFvXWY).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Highlights Complete, Dec. 9**

We are in Code Freeze. Release highlight items need to be finished and fully edited by next week.  Also, please be on the alert for any blocking test failures, and get them debugged quickly so we can release on time.

Friday is the cherry-pick deadline for the next set of patch releases.

* [**cluster-autoscaler 1.34.2**](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/tag/cluster-autoscaler-1.34.2), [**1.33.3**](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/tag/cluster-autoscaler-1.33.3), and [**1.32.5**](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/tag/cluster-autoscaler-1.32.5) align the 1.34, 1.33 and 1.32 branches with common fixes: more robust proactive scale-up handling for scheduling-gated pods, a `SimulateNodeRemoval` panic fix for missing node info, Azure LTS test updates and refreshed static SKU lists, CI/lint cleanups, and Kubernetes dependency bumps to v1.34.2, v1.33.6, and v1.32.10 respectively.
* [**cluster-api v1.12.0-rc.1**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/releases/tag/v1.12.0-rc.1) continues the v1.12 line toward GA with in-place update support for KCP and MachineDeployments, chained multi-minor Kubernetes upgrades for managed topologies, new `InPlaceUpdates`, `MachineTaintPropagation`, and `ReconcilerRateLimiting` feature gates, MachineHealthCheck condition-based health checks, plus a round of bugfixes across webhooks, e2e tests, runtime SDK, and condition handling on top of Go 1.24 and Kubernetes 0.34.x library bumps.
* [**cluster-api-provider-vsphere v1.15.0-rc.0**](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/releases/tag/v1.15.0-rc.0) tracks CAPI v1.12 and Kubernetes v1.35/cloud-provider-vsphere v1.35, introduces a dedicated CAPV ServiceAccount, and adds govmomi flags to tune CPU and memory shares, reservations, and limits, while also updating etcd/Kubernetes dependencies, bumping CPI/autoscaler versions, and hardening tests and CI (including network debug improvements and flake-focused timeouts).
* [**prometheus v3.8.0**](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v3.8.0) is the first release to mark Native Histograms as a stable opt-in feature via the new `scrape_native_histogram` config knob, updates Remote Write v2 to the 2.0-rc.4 spec, adds unified AWS service discovery (EC2, Lightsail, ECS), introduces OAuth2 JWT-bearer grant support, extends promtool with Remote Write 2.0 pushes, and delivers a broad set of PromQL, TSDB, and UI performance fixes (including faster large alerts/rules pages and improved NHCB handling).
