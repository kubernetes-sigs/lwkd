## Developer News

There have been extra patch releases due to a breaking change, see below.

Kubernetes contributor Cody Crudgington has [passed away unexpectedly](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/uhiIJoOylK8).  Cody was a dedicated Kubernetes contributor and organizer of contributor events and meetups.  He will be missed; [remember him online](https://everloved.com/life-of/cody-crudgington/).

Label changes: all kubernetes/ repos will soon have access to the [`/area community-meeting` label](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/CVkurn6mUuQ), so that you can flag an issue or PR for discussion at the monthly community meeting. Also, PRs that are auto-closed by the bot will [be labelled `Not Planned`](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/OoheR_KAwiQ).

Polls are open for the [Steering Committee election](https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/steering---2022) until Thursday, so please vote now. Your vote determines the leadership for the Kubernetes project.

Registration for the [Contributor Summit](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2022/kcsna/registration/) is still open.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Next Deadline: Production Readiness Sept. 29th**

Have your draft KEPs ready for the PRR team by Thursday, and final versions opted-in by Oct. 6. Current [CI signal is green](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/vHLnpz46MJA).

The September 15th patch releases broke user applications (see below).  As such, [new patch releases](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/tA6LNOQTR4Q) for [1.25.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md), [1.24.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md), [1.23.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), and [1.22.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) were pushed on Sept. 21.  Users should skip the prior update and go straight to this one. 


## Featured PRs

### [Limit redirect proxy handling to redirected responses #112526](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112526)

We added redirect restrictions [to the APIserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112193) in the last patch release in order to close security hole [CVE-2022-3172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112513). However, that change mistakenly treated all 300 codes as redirects, [including `304 Not Modified`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112524), breaking user code. As such, [non-redirect codes have been exempted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112526) and [new patch releases issued](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/tA6LNOQTR4Q).
