## Community Meeting Summary

The [community meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity)started with a demo of [Automation Broker](http://automationbroker.io/) by Michael Hrivnak. This is really a set of Ansible-based tools for building Service Catalog services, including the broker itself, the Ansible Playbook Bundle, and the Ansible Operator. You can even use it to run Helm.

Nishi Davidson updated us on [SIG-AWS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jDR1Esdu2ApnuLrzsGxn7iv1cU3sWc7R/view).  Subprojects `aws-alb-ingress-controller`, `aws-ebs-csi-driver`, and `out-of-tree-ccm` will be going in as alpha in 1.13.  The in-tree cloud provider will soon have e2e tests, and will be maintained until the plugin is GA, sometime in late 2019.  They've added the aws-tester plugin which creates an EKS cluster for testing.

The [SIG-Scheduling updates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ztwf24XXR6S13pFBth_W86pNWk20b5Kv7mkcFAZCgJI/edit?usp=sharing) for 1.12, per Bobby Salamat, included scheduler performance improvement, TaintNodesByCondition, ImageLocality (track which nodes have which images), and finalizing the design of the Scheduler plugin architecture.  For 1.13, they're working on gang scheduling, pod scheduling policies, implementing extension/plugin points, and improving the equivalence cache.

Paris presented [about SIG-ContribEx](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jLL5_nEKAHuhcqNOUgXhNJlgNK45gxklAROGzD8Dg8s/edit?usp=sharing).  Last cycle, they completed the contributor survey (result graphs coming soon), overhauled how the various project media are moderated, and launched [discuss.kubernetes.io](https://discuss.kubernetes.io).  Now, they're revamping the developer guide, building a new contributor site, and improving SIG Chair processes.  For the last please reach out to #sig-contribex if you have ideas.

KEPs are moving repos, [per discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/kubernetes-dev/LIkZoIqCT20/discussion), with plans to eventually become the mandatory new feature process.  The Seattle Contributor Summit is waitlisted.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Slush, November 9**

We will also be releasing the beta and creating a branch on Nov. 6th.  Code freeze is just 2 weeks away, so try to finish up your work for 1.13.  Once code slush starts, PRs [must be labeled completely](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/release.md#tldr).

We have also finalized the [criteria for blocking tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/346) and will be re-shuffling the test boards in accord with them.

Updates 1.11.4 and 1.12.2 were released last week.
