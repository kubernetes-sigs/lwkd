See below about changes to the Enhancements process.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release schedule & team completed, September 9th**

The enhancements team is planning to [use a GitHub project board](http://bit.ly/k8s126-enhancements) to track enhancements. This will [make the feature opt-in process different](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/R1afPL7zpT4) (and hopefully better): instead of adding your SIG's features to a spreadsheet, SIG leads tag them with the label `lead-opted-in`.

Cherry-picks for the next round of patch releases are due September 9th.  This update will involve [new golang versions](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/rlvRpp6WVVY/m/yF7eGkiSBQAJ?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer), again.

## Featured PRs

### [website#33992: Add a security checklist for clusters](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/33992)

SIG-Security and SIG-Docs have helped develop a "you should at least know about all these things" [checklist for securing a production Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/security-checklist/). This is a great resource for helping new admins get up to speed or, perhaps, checking if you haven't missed anything critical in this fast moving world of threat management. A highly recommended read for all.

### [website#35908: New Docs page for API Server Bypass Risks](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/35908)

A security two-for-one week! SIG-Security has also written up a guide for understanding the [major attack surfaces of Kubernetes outside of kube-apiserver](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/api-server-bypass-risks/). Many of these will be well known to long-time contributors and users but they are easy to miss when designing a security posture and a refresher never hurt anyone.

## Deprecated

* The [removal of unused kubectl run flags](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110668) was [reverted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112243) because it didn't follow the deprecation process; they'll be actually removed in 1.27
