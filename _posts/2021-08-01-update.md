## Developer News

This week is (hopefully) 1.22 Release Week

LWKD is now [officially a publication](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lwkd) of SIG-ContribEx Contributor Comms!  So if you want to contribute to our weekly newsletter, that's now a legit Kubernetes contribution.  Please?  Find us on #sig-contribex on Slack if you have questions.

Subproject [bootkube](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2824) is being transferred to current maintainers Kinvolk, and superceded project [cluster-api-bootstrap-provider-kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2845) has been archived.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.22 Released, Wed August 4**

This is the final few days to debug 1.22, so if you get tagged on a test fail please respond ASAP.  Fortunately, due to great work across the project, we are down to 2 flakes in [1.22-Blocking](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.22-blocking) and 4 in [1.22-Informing](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-1.22-informing), and no failures. So things look good for the release.

Adolfo García Veytia published an excellent [explanation of how release branch cherry-picks work now](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/NiKByLbWZ1g).

Speaking of cherry-picks, the deadline for patch releases is this Saturday, August 7.

## Merges

* Backport [cert signing request fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103823) to all supported versions
* mount-utils is a [dependency of legacy-cloud-providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103935)

## Reversions

* Adding a namespace label to admission metrics [has been reverted](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104033) because it caused issues with the memory size of the metrics histogram
