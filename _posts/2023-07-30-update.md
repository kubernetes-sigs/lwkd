LWKD is adding "Featured KEP" as a new section to our weekly newsletter, thanks to new contributor Sreeram Venkitesh.  You, too, could [contribute to LWKD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lwkd/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Themes and Docs Complete, August 8**

Hopefully all your features are debugged and you're hard at work on revising documentation, because those docs need to be edited and finished in a week. Then on to the release!  As always during code freeze, please watch for and respond promptly to any test failures.

This Friday is also the deadline for cherry-picks for the next round of patch releases.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP 2340 - Consistent Reads from Cache](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/2340-Consistent-reads-from-cache)

This KEP introduces serving of most GET and LIST requests from the watch cache of the kube apiserver, instead of serving the request from etcd everytime.  This KEP was first created on December 10th, 2019 and was authored by Joe Betz, Wojciech Tyczynski and Marek Siarkowicz.  It was brought to alpha in v1.28 three weeks ago in [kubernetes/kubernetes PR#118508](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/118508).  This alpha PR by Marek Siarkowicz introduces a `ConsistentListFromCache` feature gate that enables the apiserver to serve consistent requests from the watch cache.  He had also implemented `conditionalProgressRequester` for requesting watch progress notification if the watch cache is not fresh, which was extracted to [kubernetes/kubernetes PR#119207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/119207) from his original PR. Although this KEP has been around for a while, it is getting into alpha now. It was [recently revived](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/4047) and a new approach with `WatchProgressRequest` was chosen to drop dependency on the etcd configuration.
