## Developer News

The new version of Testgrid [is now the only version](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/dF5h3XuDV7k).  Enjoy!

The #kubernetes-dev Slack channel [is becoming #contributor-discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/ShYNQY90k5c), in an effort to keep the channel focused on contributors, rather than application developers (who have other channels to choose from).

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, Feb. 9**

The 1.21 team is looking for you to register your planned features and changes via the new [Enhancements Process](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/Hn1bm9YJP6c).  This involves adding your enhancement to the [tracking sheet](http://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements) instead of filing an issue.

[1.21.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md), [1.20.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md), [1.19.7](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md), [1.18.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md), and [1.17.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.17.md) all came out last week. This is possibly the last update release for 1.17, so consider upgrading to 1.18 or later real soon.

## Featured PRs

### [community#5413: Update PRR description based on community feedback](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/5413)

Following from last weeks discussion on how to handle Production Readiness Review for KEPs, the proposal for it to be mandatory has been reintroduced after some tweaking. This includes clear documentation on the process and how to volunteer as a PRR reviewer so the team can grow over time, reducing the chances of a review bottleneck. The updates to the PRR policies are still ongoing so please do check out the pull request and provide feedback!

If you are interested in joining the PRR team, please join `#prod-readiness` in Slack and check out review process guidelines in the document.
