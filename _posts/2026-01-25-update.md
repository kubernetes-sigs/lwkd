## Featured PRs

* [136450: DRA: support non-pod references in ReservedFor](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136450)

This PR improves the robustness of the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) controller by allowing it to gracefully handle non-pod references in `ResourceClaim.status.reservedFor`. Instead of failing and halting cleanup when encountering unknown references, the controller now skips them while continuing to clean up stale pod references. This prevents unnecessary controller failures and ensures more reliable resource lifecycle management.

* [136389: Promote KEP-5311 (Relaxed validation for Services names) to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136389)

This PR promotes the *RelaxedServiceNameValidation* feature to Beta and enables it by default. Service names are now validated using `NameIsDNSLabel()`, relaxing the previous stricter rules. This makes Service naming more flexible while maintaining DNS compatibility, improving usability without compromising correctness.
