## Developer News

SIG-Instrumentation plans to remove the `apiserver_envelope_encryption_key_id_hash_total` metric in Kubernetes v1.36 because it no longer worked as intended and caused [API server performance issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/134002). The information provided by this metric can be obtained by other means. The metric had earlier required API server restarts to stay accurate, which was deemed unreasonable, and SIG-Auth discussions indicated no active users relying on it.

The Kubernetes Steering Committee opened the annual SIG reporting cycle, asking SIGs to submit their annual [reports](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/8756) by February 28.



## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, February 4**

Welcome to the 1.36 Release Cycle with Release Lead Ryota and [the whole release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.36/release-team.md) !  We have begun work on it, which starts with the call for [Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md).  We now have a [full release calendar](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.36):

* PRR Freeze: Feb. 4
* Enhancements Freeze: Feb. 11
* Code Freeze: March 18
* Docs Freeze: April 8
* Release: April 22

January patch releases are [still delayed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Ffz6xyPf3xw), now due to some golang security updates.  They should be out soon.

## Featured PRs

* [136450: DRA: support non-pod references in ReservedFor](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136450)

This PR improves the robustness of the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) controller by allowing it to gracefully handle non-pod references in `ResourceClaim.status.reservedFor`. Instead of failing and halting cleanup when encountering unknown references, the controller now skips them while continuing to clean up stale pod references. This prevents unnecessary controller failures and ensures more reliable resource lifecycle management.

* [136389: Promote KEP-5311 (Relaxed validation for Services names) to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136389)

This PR promotes the *RelaxedServiceNameValidation* feature to Beta and enables it by default. Service names are now validated using `NameIsDNSLabel()`, relaxing the previous stricter rules. This makes Service naming more flexible while maintaining DNS compatibility, improving usability without compromising correctness.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-127: Support User Namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces/README.md#kep-127-support-user-namespaces)

This KEP introduces support for Linux user namespaces in Kubernetes to improve container security. It allows processes to run as root inside pods while mapping to unprivileged users on the host, reducing the impact of container escapes. This isolation mitigates multiple high-severity vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-5736 (runc overwrite) and other critical container escape and privilege escalation issues. Overall, user namespaces strengthen Kubernetes’ security model against both known and future threats.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
