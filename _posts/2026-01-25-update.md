## KEP of the Week

[KEP-127: Support User Namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces/README.md#kep-127-support-user-namespaces)

This KEP introduces support for Linux user namespaces in Kubernetes to improve container security. It allows processes to run as root inside pods while mapping to unprivileged users on the host, reducing the impact of container escapes. This isolation mitigates multiple high-severity vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-5736 (runc overwrite) and other critical container escape and privilege escalation issues. Overall, user namespaces strengthen Kubernetes’ security model against both known and future threats.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
