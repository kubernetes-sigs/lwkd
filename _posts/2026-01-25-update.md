## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: PRR Freeze, February 4**

Welcome to the 1.36 Release Cycle with Release Lead Ryota and [the whole release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.36/release-team.md) !  We have begun work on it, which starts with the call for [Enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md).  We now have a [full release calendar](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.36):

* PRR Freeze: Feb. 4
* Enhancements Freeze: Feb. 11
* Code Freeze: March 18
* Docs Freeze: April 8
* Release: April 22

January patch releases are [still delayed](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/Ffz6xyPf3xw), now due to some golang security updates.  They should be out soon.

## Featured PRs

* [136450: DRA: support non-pod references in ReservedFor](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136450)

This PR improves the robustness of the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) controller by allowing it to gracefully handle non-pod references in `ResourceClaim.status.reservedFor`. Instead of failing and halting cleanup when encountering unknown references, the controller now skips them while continuing to clean up stale pod references. This prevents unnecessary controller failures and ensures more reliable resource lifecycle management.

* [136389: Promote KEP-5311 (Relaxed validation for Services names) to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136389)

This PR promotes the *RelaxedServiceNameValidation* feature to Beta and enables it by default. Service names are now validated using `NameIsDNSLabel()`, relaxing the previous stricter rules. This makes Service naming more flexible while maintaining DNS compatibility, improving usability without compromising correctness.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-127: Support User Namespaces](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/127-user-namespaces/README.md#kep-127-support-user-namespaces)

This KEP introduces support for Linux user namespaces in Kubernetes to improve container security. It allows processes to run as root inside pods while mapping to unprivileged users on the host, reducing the impact of container escapes. This isolation mitigates multiple high-severity vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-5736 (runc overwrite) and other critical container escape and privilege escalation issues. Overall, user namespaces strengthen Kubernetes’ security model against both known and future threats.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
