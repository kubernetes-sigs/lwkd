## Developer News

We will be having a Contributor Summit at KubeCon EU, on May 16th, which will be mostly unconference format.  More news, links, etc. later.

Last week was [Community Meeting](http://bit.ly/k8scommunity) week.  Topics discussed included:

It's been a year since we [changed to 3 releases a year](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/0def15c4112e07a529a30d6dc402948a17d97a1e/keps/sig-release/2572-release-cadence), so it's time to evaluate if the change will be permanent.  Per initial survey results so far, most people like it.  But there's [still time to fill out the survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/k8s-cadence-2022).

We will be [disabling new Beta APIs by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3137) in 1.24, since if an API is on by default it's kinda sorta production and not really beta anymore.  Old beta APIs will not be disabled, though.

Finally, we had a long discussion around how to improve Kubernetes reliability long-term. Many contributors shared ideas, including emulating SIG-Node's CI project, more stringent enforcement of test requirements on new features, and making TestGrid easier to understand. Since declining reliability is a problem five years in development, we'll need more than a few months of effort to change it. Share your thoughts on the [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/3139) or the [dev thread](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/ai8SetaxYuk).

Video and transcripts for the Community Meeting will be up soon.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Code Freeze, March 30th**

All of the enhancements, including ones with exceptions, are done.  We're now in the countdown to code freeze, so get your last bit of code tweaked and your tests written.

CI Signal for 1.24 is still [not happy](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking), with four flakes and a failure in Blocking, and lots more in Informing.  Chief among these is the [skew failure](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108307), which has now been failing for a month, and appears to be a test code issue.  If you're familiar with the skew tests, please pitch in.  Folks also resolved a [containerd issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/108715) in the scalability tests.

Patch releases [1.23.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md), [1.22.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md), and [1.21.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md). There are a *lot* of backported bugfixes in these updates, so please apply them as soon as you can.
