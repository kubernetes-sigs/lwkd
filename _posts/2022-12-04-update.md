## Developer News

K8s-infra reminds you to use `registry.k8s.io` and not older registry addresses.

Tim Hockin [talks about a new schedule for reviewing KEPs](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/rEOttI9_6ng).

Several [outdated CSI repos](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/3378) have been archived.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: 1.26 Release, December 8th**

Both the 1.26 release and the patch releases have been *delayed* because of the release of security Golang patches 1.19.4 and 1.18.9.  The release team and patch team need time to integrate and test the new versions.
