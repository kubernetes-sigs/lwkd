## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:  [Feature blog freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#feature-blog-freeze), 27th February 2026**

Feature blog blurbs for v1.36 are due next week. Wrap up your submissions and get ready — Code Freeze is next.

Patch Releases [1.35.1](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.35.md), [1.34.4](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.34.md), [1.33.8](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md), [1.32.12](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.32.md) were published last week, delivering the latest fix and updates.

## Featured PRs

* [136998: Migrate HPA MinReplicas to Declarative Validation with Feature Gate Support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136998)

This PR migrates validation of `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec.MinReplicas` to Kubernetes’ declarative validation framework with feature-gate awareness. It ensures validation dynamically respects the `HPAScaleToZero` feature gate, improving consistency, maintainability, and correctness of API validation as Kubernetes continues moving toward declarative validation.

* [136952: Add kubelet_metrics_provider metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136952)

This PR introduces the `kubelet_metrics_provider` metric to help users identify which metrics provider kubelet uses to expose container statistics. The metric improves observability and debugging capabilities and supports monitoring requirements from the CRI stats KEP.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4762: Allows setting arbitrary FQDN as the pod's hostname](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4762-allow-arbitrary-fqdn-as-pod-hostname/README.md)

This proposal introduces a new `hostnameOverride` field in the `podSpec` that allows users to set any Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a pod’s hostname. Once the API reaches GA, the Kubelet will always respect this field, bypassing the legacy behavior that derives hostnames from the `hostname` and `subdomain` fields and appends a cluster-specific suffix. By removing this restriction, pods can use exact FQDNs without automatic modification. The primary goal is to improve compatibility with traditional or legacy applications that rely on specific hostnames for authentication, authorization, or service logic. This change simplifies migration to Kubernetes by enabling strict DNS-based hostname matching required by some older systems.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.

## Shoutout
* Sreeram Venkitesh: Big shoutout to @aibarbetta for handling the v1.36.0-alpha.1 cut so gracefully despite the delays even after it being her first time doing a release cut! Congratulations! Special thanks to @xmudrii for all the help!
* xmudrii :A big shoutout to @mahamed and @bentheelder on behalf of Kubernetes Release Engineering! @mahamed migrated the Kubernetes release process to the community-owned infrastructure on a very short notice and made it significantly faster! 
  This will save us a lot of time and give us better control over the release infrastructure enabling further improvements!@bentheelder has done significant work to simplify the Go update process in Kubernetes. 
  This will enable us to deliver Go updates in Kubernetes much faster, which is especially important for Go updates that come with security fixes!
