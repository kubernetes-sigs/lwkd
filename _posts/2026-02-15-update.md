## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:  [Feature blog freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#feature-blog-freeze), 27th February 2026**

Feature blog blurbs for v1.36 are due next week. Wrap up your submissions and get ready — Code Freeze is next.

## Featured PRs

* [136998: Migrate HPA MinReplicas to Declarative Validation with Feature Gate Support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136998)

This PR migrates validation of `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec.MinReplicas` to Kubernetes’ declarative validation framework with feature-gate awareness. It ensures validation dynamically respects the `HPAScaleToZero` feature gate, improving consistency, maintainability, and correctness of API validation as Kubernetes continues moving toward declarative validation.

* [136952: Add kubelet_metrics_provider metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136952)

This PR introduces the `kubelet_metrics_provider` metric to help users identify which metrics provider kubelet uses to expose container statistics. The metric improves observability and debugging capabilities and supports monitoring requirements from the CRI stats KEP.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-4762: Allows setting arbitrary FQDN as the pod's hostname](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4762-allow-arbitrary-fqdn-as-pod-hostname/README.md)

This proposal introduces a new `hostnameOverride` field in the `podSpec` that allows users to set any Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a pod’s hostname. Once the API reaches GA, the Kubelet will always respect this field, bypassing the legacy behavior that derives hostnames from the `hostname` and `subdomain` fields and appends a cluster-specific suffix. By removing this restriction, pods can use exact FQDNs without automatic modification. The primary goal is to improve compatibility with traditional or legacy applications that rely on specific hostnames for authentication, authorization, or service logic. This change simplifies migration to Kubernetes by enabling strict DNS-based hostname matching required by some older systems.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
