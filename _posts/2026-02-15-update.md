[KEP-4762: Allows setting arbitrary FQDN as the pod's hostname](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-network/4762-allow-arbitrary-fqdn-as-pod-hostname/README.md)

This proposal introduces a new `hostnameOverride` field in the `podSpec` that allows users to set any Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as a pod’s hostname. Once the API reaches GA, the Kubelet will always respect this field, bypassing the legacy behavior that derives hostnames from the `hostname` and `subdomain` fields and appends a cluster-specific suffix. By removing this restriction, pods can use exact FQDNs without automatic modification. The primary goal is to improve compatibility with traditional or legacy applications that rely on specific hostnames for authentication, authorization, or service logic. This change simplifies migration to Kubernetes by enabling strict DNS-based hostname matching required by some older systems.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
