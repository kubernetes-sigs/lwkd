* [136998: Migrate HPA MinReplicas to Declarative Validation with Feature Gate Support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136998)

This PR migrates validation of `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec.MinReplicas` to Kubernetes’ declarative validation framework with feature-gate awareness. It ensures validation dynamically respects the `HPAScaleToZero` feature gate, improving consistency, maintainability, and correctness of API validation as Kubernetes continues moving toward declarative validation.

* [136952: Add kubelet_metrics_provider metric](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136952)

This PR introduces the `kubelet_metrics_provider` metric to help users identify which metrics provider kubelet uses to expose container statistics. The metric improves observability and debugging capabilities and supports monitoring requirements from the CRI stats KEP.
