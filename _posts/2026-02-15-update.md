## Shoutout
* Sreeram Venkitesh: Big shoutout to @aibarbetta for handling the v1.36.0-alpha.1 cut so gracefully despite the delays even after it being her first time doing a release cut! Congratulations! Special thanks to @xmudrii for all the help!
* xmudrii :A big shoutout to @mahamed and @bentheelder on behalf of Kubernetes Release Engineering! @mahamed migrated the Kubernetes release process to the community-owned infrastructure on a very short notice and made it significantly faster! 
  This will save us a lot of time and give us better control over the release infrastructure enabling further improvements!@bentheelder has done significant work to simplify the Go update process in Kubernetes. 
  This will enable us to deliver Go updates in Kubernetes much faster, which is especially important for Go updates that come with security fixes!
