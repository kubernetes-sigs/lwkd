## Developer News

Next Tuesday is the monthly [New Contributor Orientation](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/orientation/). Join at [one of two times](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/calendar/) to learn all about starting your contribution journey.

Kind will start using [kubeadm v1beta4](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubeadm-config.v1beta4/) configuration for Kubernetes 1.36, introducing breaking changes that may require updates to tools, scripts, and configs. Benjamin has asked maintainers to review the [v0.31.0 release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/tag/v0.31.0#user-content-kubeadm-config) and update their setups accordingly.

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Release Cycle Begins**

The release team [leads have been chosen](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.36/release-team.md) and they are selecting their shadows.

Patch releases have been [delayed 1 week](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/bKaOvcJfi0A); cherry-picks are due this Friday, with patches to come out next Wednesday.
