## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline:**


## Featured PRs

* [136086: Graduate `watch_list_duration_seconds` to Beta](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136086)

This PR graduates the `watch_list_duration_seconds` metric to Beta. Previously, the metric was Alpha and not guaranteed to remain stable. With this change, the metric’s behavior and labels are now considered stable, making it safe for long-term monitoring, alerting, and observability tooling.

* [136117: Enable declarative-native validation for API strategies](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136117)

This PR adds utilities that allow API `strategy.go` files to opt into declarative-native validation. Native declarative validations now run even when the DeclarativeValidation feature gate is disabled, ensuring critical IDL-defined rules are always enforced and preventing validation bypasses due to misconfiguration or panics.
