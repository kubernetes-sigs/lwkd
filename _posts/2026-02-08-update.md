[KEP-5573: Remove cgroup v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/5573-remove-cgroup-v1/README.md)

This KEP proposes deprecating and ultimately removing cgroup v1 support from the Kubernetes codebase, building on the maintenance-mode transition introduced in KEP-4569. The change will follow a phased approach, starting with a beta phase that prevents kubelet from running on cgroup v1 nodes. While Kubernetes commits to removing cgroup v1–specific code, the exact timeline is not yet finalized, with removal planned no earlier than v1.38 to comply with Kubernetes deprecation policies. This effort aligns Kubernetes with the broader Linux ecosystem’s shift toward cgroup v2, which is the focus of ongoing kernel and system-level innovation.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
