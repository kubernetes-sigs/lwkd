## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Enhancements Freeze, February 11**

[Kubernetes v1.36.0-alpha.1](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/3Q9hqNwHWEU) is live!

This week is the final [Enhancements deadline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#enhancements-freeze) for 1.36. Any KEP that wishes to join the v1.36 release, must now have an approved [Exception] (https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

[January and February patch releases](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/fkXitM-lNmw) are being combined and the patch release is expected this week.

## Featured PRs

* [#136118: Make ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136118)

This PR graduates the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature to GA in Kubernetes v1.36 and locks the feature gate to enabled by default. It finalizes support for external signing of service account tokens, allowing kube-apiserver to delegate token signing to external systems via a configured signing endpoint. The graduation follows successful integrations by major cloud providers and feedback from distributions, marking this as a stable and supported authentication mechanism.

* [#136781: feat(wait): introduce waitOptions.RunWaitContext()](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136781)

This PR adds `RunWaitContext()` to kubectl’s wait command implementation, allowing callers to supply a `context.Context` to control cancellation. This improves composability for tools and integrations that wrap `kubectl wait`, enabling graceful early exits without relying solely on timeouts. The change enhances kubectl’s internal APIs without altering user-facing behavior.

* [#136539: feat(ccm): introduce metric route_controller_route_sync_total](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136539)

This PR introduces a new alpha-stage Cloud Controller Manager metric, `route_controller_route_sync_total`, which tracks how often routes are synchronized with the cloud provider. The metric supports observability and experimentation around the watch-based route reconciliation feature and provides valuable insight for SIG Cloud Provider and SIG Instrumentation as the feature evolves.

## KEP of the Week

[KEP-5573: Remove cgroup v1](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/5573-remove-cgroup-v1/README.md)

This KEP proposes deprecating and ultimately removing cgroup v1 support from the Kubernetes codebase, building on the maintenance-mode transition introduced in KEP-4569. The change will follow a phased approach, starting with a beta phase that prevents kubelet from running on cgroup v1 nodes. While Kubernetes commits to removing cgroup v1–specific code, the exact timeline is not yet finalized, with removal planned no earlier than v1.38 to comply with Kubernetes deprecation policies. This effort aligns Kubernetes with the broader Linux ecosystem’s shift toward cgroup v2, which is the focus of ongoing kernel and system-level innovation.

This KEP graduated to beta in v1.35.
