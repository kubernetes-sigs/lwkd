## Featured PRs

* [#136118: Make ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136118)

This PR graduates the `ExternalServiceAccountTokenSigner` feature to GA in Kubernetes v1.36 and locks the feature gate to enabled by default. It finalizes support for external signing of service account tokens, allowing kube-apiserver to delegate token signing to external systems via a configured signing endpoint. The graduation follows successful integrations by major cloud providers and feedback from distributions, marking this as a stable and supported authentication mechanism.

* [#136781: feat(wait): introduce waitOptions.RunWaitContext()](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136781)

This PR adds `RunWaitContext()` to kubectl’s wait command implementation, allowing callers to supply a `context.Context` to control cancellation. This improves composability for tools and integrations that wrap `kubectl wait`, enabling graceful early exits without relying solely on timeouts. The change enhances kubectl’s internal APIs without altering user-facing behavior.

* [#136539: feat(ccm): introduce metric route_controller_route_sync_total](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/136539)

This PR introduces a new alpha-stage Cloud Controller Manager metric, `route_controller_route_sync_total`, which tracks how often routes are synchronized with the cloud provider. The metric supports observability and experimentation around the watch-based route reconciliation feature and provides valuable insight for SIG Cloud Provider and SIG Instrumentation as the feature evolves.
