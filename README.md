# Last Week In Kubernetes Development

[The LWKD repository](https://github.com/lwkd/lwkd.github.io) contains the .md files used to produce the weekly Kubernetes updates called "Last Week in Kubernetes Development", or LWKD.  Contributions by pull request are encouraged and accepted.

## Contributing

Every Monday, a new issue of LWKD will come out.  At the same time, we will add a new week's blank newsletter to the appropriate "weeks" folder.  Once that happens, we will start accepting pull requests to modify that week.

If you don't feel like creating a pull request, or there's too many edit conflicts already, then add your item as an Issue.

What we're looking for:

* Reports on PRs and merges for significant features and changes to core Kubernetes and its close components (like KubeAdm and Helm).
* Summary of the weekly Community Meeting and any Steering Committee meetings.
* Updates, deadlines, and current status on the release in progress.
* Notices of deprecated features, plugins, and APIs.
* Notices of version number changes and dependency version changes.
* "Graph of the Week" from devstats.

We are **not** looking for information about upcoming events, external blog posts, new projects or products, or other Kubernetes "ecosystem" news, all of which is well-covered by KubeWeekly.

More than anything, please **be brief**.  A major goal of LWKD is to provide a summary of Kubernetes activity which can be taken in in 15 minutes or less.  The ideal item for LWKD is one sentence and a link.

You may optionally credit yourself at the end of each item you add with your initials in italics, like so:

* We now have automated tests using the [vSphere Cloud Provider simulator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/55918) *JMB*

Should you do this, please make sure to add your initials, name and contact link to the authors.md file.
