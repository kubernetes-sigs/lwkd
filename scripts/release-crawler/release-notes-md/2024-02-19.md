## Changelog since v1.29.1

### Changes by Kind

#### Other
 - Enable automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation of ttrpc calls to NRI plugins when tracing is globally enabled in cri-o.
  - Bumped NRI deps also fixes a bug where starting a cri-o launched NRI plugin could cause the accidental closing of an unrelated fd (socket, file, etc.) due to an fd double-close bug. (#7730, @klihub)

#### Failing Test
 - None (#7734, @klihub)

#### Bug or Regression
 - Reverted image ID field change in the container status. While the change did fix an issue with Kubelet image GC, it caused an unintended change in the container status of the Kubernetes pod API, breaking an accidentally stable API. (#7803, @saschagrunert)

#### Uncategorized
 - Add support for --metrics-host. (#7700, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)
 - Fix a bug where a container that exits soon after a StopContainer request is issued will be paused in termination for longer than the grace period (#7737, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)
 - Restore infra containers state on CRI-O restart. Without this, the infra containers will be accounted as missing, leading to a spurious error message. (#7749, @openshift-cherrypick-robot)

## containerd/nerdctl  
### Release notes for v2.0.0-beta.1  
#### 2024-02-19  
## Changes
nerdctl v2 enables "detach-netns" for Rootless mode by default (#2723).

This will bring:
- Faster and more stable `nerdctl pull`, `nerdctl push`, `nerdctl build`, etc
- Proper support for `nerdctl pull 127.0.0.1:.../...`
- Proper support for `nerdctl run --net=host`

Depends on RootlessKit v2 and BuildKit v0.13 (included in `nerdctl-full-*.tar.gz`).

> [!NOTE]
> After upgrading nerdctl (rootless mode) from v1.x to v2.x, it is highly recommended to
> re-install the systemd units and the configurations:
> ```
> containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh uninstall
> rm -rf ~/.config/{nerdctl,buildkit}
> containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
> CONTAINERD_NAMESPACE=default containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install-buildkit-containerd
> ```

Other major changes:
- `nerdctl run`:
  - Add `--systemd` flag for running systemd in containers flag (#2785, thanks to @sazzy4o)
  - Add`--ipc=(shareable|container:<container>)` flag (#2757, thanks to @minuk-dev)
- `nerdctl build`:
  - Add `--attest`, `--sbom`, and `--provenance` flags (#2786, thanks to @yankay)

Thanks to @fahedouch @manugupt1 @minuk-dev @monirul @roman-kiselenko @sazzy4o @yankay @zwpaper

## Quick start
### Rootful
```console
$ sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
$ sudo nerdctl run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 nginx:alpine
```

### Rootless
```console
$ containerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
$ nerdctl run -d --name nginx -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine
```

Enabling cgroup v2 is highly recommended for rootless mode, see https://rootlesscontaine.rs/getting-started/common/cgroup2/ .
