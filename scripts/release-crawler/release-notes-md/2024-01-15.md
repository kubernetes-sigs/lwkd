## prometheus/prometheus  
### Release notes for 2.49.1 / 2024-01-15  
#### 2024-01-15  
* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fixed a wrong `q=` value in scrape accept header #13313  
### Release notes for 2.49.0 / 2024-01-15  
#### 2024-01-15  
* [FEATURE] Promtool: Add `--run` flag promtool test rules command. #12206
* [FEATURE] SD: Add support for `NS` records to DNS SD. #13219
* [FEATURE] UI: Add heatmap visualization setting in the Graph tab, useful histograms. #13096 #13371
* [FEATURE] Scraping: Add `scrape_config.enable_compression` (default true) to disable gzip compression when scraping the target. #13166
* [FEATURE] PromQL: Add a `promql-experimental-functions` feature flag containing some new experimental PromQL functions. #13103 NOTE: More experimental functions might be added behind the same feature flag in the future. Added functions:
  * Experimental `mad_over_time` (median absolute deviation around the median) function. #13059
  * Experimental `sort_by_label` and `sort_by_label_desc` functions allowing sorting returned series by labels. #11299
* [FEATURE] SD: Add `__meta_linode_gpus` label to Linode SD. #13097
* [FEATURE] API: Add `exclude_alerts` query parameter to `/api/v1/rules` to only return recording rules. #12999
* [FEATURE] TSDB: --storage.tsdb.retention.time flag value is now exposed as a `prometheus_tsdb_retention_limit_seconds` metric. #12986
* [FEATURE] Scraping: Add ability to specify priority of scrape protocols to accept during scrape (e.g. to scrape Prometheus proto format for certain jobs). This can be changed by setting `global.scrape_protocols` and `scrape_config.scrape_protocols`. #12738
* [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping: Automated handling of scraping histograms that violate `scrape_config.native_histogram_bucket_limit` setting. #13129
* [ENHANCEMENT] Scraping: Optimized memory allocations when scraping. #12992
* [ENHANCEMENT] SD: Added cache for Azure SD to avoid rate-limits. #12622
* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Various improvements to OOO exemplar scraping. E.g. allowing ingestion of exemplars with the same timestamp, but with different labels. #13021
* [ENHANCEMENT] API: Optimize `/api/v1/labels` and `/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values` when 1 set of matchers are used. #12888
* [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Various optimizations for TSDB block index, head mmap chunks and WAL, reducing latency and memory allocations (improving API calls, compaction queries etc). #12997 #13058 #13056 #13040
* [ENHANCEMENT] PromQL: Optimize memory allocations and latency when querying float histograms. #12954
* [ENHANCEMENT] Rules: Instrument TraceID in log lines for rule evaluations. #13034
* [ENHANCEMENT] PromQL: Optimize memory allocations in query_range calls. #13043
* [ENHANCEMENT] Promtool: unittest interval now defaults to evaluation_intervals when not set. #12729
* [BUGFIX] SD: Fixed Azure SD public IP reporting #13241
* [BUGFIX] API: Fix inaccuracies in posting cardinality statistics. #12653
* [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix inaccuracies of `histogram_quantile` with classic histograms. #13153

* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix rare panics on append commit when exemplars are used. #13092
* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix exemplar WAL storage, so remote write can send/receive samples before exemplars. #13113
* [BUGFIX] Mixins: Fix `url` filter on remote write dashboards. #10721
* [BUGFIX] PromQL/TSDB: Various fixes to float histogram operations. #12891 #12977 #12609 #13190 #13189 #13191 #13201 #13212 #13208

### Release notes for containerd 2.0.0-beta.1  
#### 2024-01-19  
Welcome to the v2.0.0-beta.1 release of containerd!
*This is a pre-release of containerd*

The first major release of containerd 2.x focuses on the continued stability of
containerd's core feature set with an easy upgrade from containerd 1.x. This
release includes the stabilization of new features added in the last 1.x release
as well as the removal of features which were deprecated in 1.x. The goal is to
support the vast community of containerd users well into the future along with
their ever increasing deployment footprints and variety of use cases.

Previous release can be found at [v1.7.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.0)
### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.31 (Ubuntu 20.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on non-glibc Linux distributions. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.

See also the [Getting Started](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) documentation.
