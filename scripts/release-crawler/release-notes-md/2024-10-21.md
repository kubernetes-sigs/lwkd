## prometheus/prometheus  
### Release notes for 2.55.0-rc.1 / 2024-10-16  
#### [prometheus v2.55.0-rc.1](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.55.0-rc.1)  
#### 2024-10-17  
The next release candidate of Prometheus v2.55 has a few bug-fixes to queries, plus the experimental `info` function which we are including to facilitate feedback.

* [BUGFIX] PromQL: make sort_by_label stable. #14985
* [BUGFIX] TSDB: Don't read in-order chunks from before head MinTime #15162
