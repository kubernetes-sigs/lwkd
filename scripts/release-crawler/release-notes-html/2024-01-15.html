<li>[BUGFIX] TSDB: Fixed a wrong <code>q=</code> value in scrape accept header #13313</li>
</ul>
<br><h3>Release notes for 2.49.0 / 2024-01-15</h3><h4>2024-01-15</h4><ul>
<li>[FEATURE] Promtool: Add <code>--run</code> flag promtool test rules command. #12206</li>
<li>[FEATURE] SD: Add support for <code>NS</code> records to DNS SD. #13219</li>
<li>[FEATURE] UI: Add heatmap visualization setting in the Graph tab, useful histograms. #13096 #13371</li>
<li>[FEATURE] Scraping: Add <code>scrape_config.enable_compression</code> (default true) to disable gzip compression when scraping the target. #13166</li>
<li>[FEATURE] PromQL: Add a <code>promql-experimental-functions</code> feature flag containing some new experimental PromQL functions. #13103 NOTE: More experimental functions might be added behind the same feature flag in the future. Added functions:

<ul>
<li>Experimental <code>mad_over_time</code> (median absolute deviation around the median) function. #13059</li>
<li>Experimental <code>sort_by_label</code> and <code>sort_by_label_desc</code> functions allowing sorting returned series by labels. #11299</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[FEATURE] SD: Add <code>__meta_linode_gpus</code> label to Linode SD. #13097</li>
<li>[FEATURE] API: Add <code>exclude_alerts</code> query parameter to <code>/api/v1/rules</code> to only return recording rules. #12999</li>
<li>[FEATURE] TSDB: &ndash;storage.tsdb.retention.time flag value is now exposed as a <code>prometheus_tsdb_retention_limit_seconds</code> metric. #12986</li>
<li>[FEATURE] Scraping: Add ability to specify priority of scrape protocols to accept during scrape (e.g. to scrape Prometheus proto format for certain jobs). This can be changed by setting <code>global.scrape_protocols</code> and <code>scrape_config.scrape_protocols</code>. #12738</li>
<li>[ENHANCEMENT] Scraping: Automated handling of scraping histograms that violate <code>scrape_config.native_histogram_bucket_limit</code> setting. #13129</li>

<li>[ENHANCEMENT] API: Optimize <code>/api/v1/labels</code> and <code>/api/v1/label/&lt;label_name&gt;/values</code> when 1 set of matchers are used. #12888</li>
<li>[ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Various optimizations for TSDB block index, head mmap chunks and WAL, reducing latency and memory allocations (improving API calls, compaction queries etc). #12997 #13058 #13056 #13040</li>
<li>[ENHANCEMENT] PromQL: Optimize memory allocations and latency when querying float histograms. #12954</li>

<em>This is a pre-release of containerd</em></p>

<p>The first major release of containerd 2.x focuses on the continued stability of

their ever increasing deployment footprints and variety of use cases.</p>
